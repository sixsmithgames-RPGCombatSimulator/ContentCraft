When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can expend 1 charge and take a reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.\n\tExpunge Imbalance. As a bonus action, you can expend 2 charges to cast the Lesser Restoration spell from the armor.\nThe armor regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.\nForce Beads (6)\nRing of Radiant Resistance\nScrolls: Teleport (2), Wall of Force, Forcecage (2), Eyebite, Greater Invisibility (3), Disintegrate, Arcane Gate, Symbol, Plane Shift, Mass Suggestion.\nAlchemy Jug\nDecanter of Endless Water\nEversmoking Bottle\nImmovable Rod\nSending Stones (Paired key charmed people)\nDust of Disappearance (3 uses)\nOil of Slipperiness\nSovereign Glue\nUniversal Solvent\nFolding Boat\n\nBloodforged Equipment:\nBloodforged Sunlight Shield (Blood infused, attuned): This is a custom, one-of-a-kind item of her own manufacture. It appears as an intricately woven silver chain tiara with a single star shaped onyx gem at the center. Use reaction to spend one of its 5 blood infusions to create a shadowy bubble around her (like resilient sphere spell) that allows her to see out, but blocks line of sight to her, blocks sunlight, and blocks radiant damage for one minute.\nBloodforged All-purpose Tool (+3 Arcane Focus, attuned)\nBloodforged Ring of Spell Storing (attuned): Shield (x3), Silvery Barbs.\nBloodforged Ring of Spell Storing (attuned): Wall of Force\nBloodforge Shield Guardian Amulet (attuned): Comes with a bloodforged Shield Guardian\nBloodforged Invisibility Cloak (attuned)\nBloodforge Guardian Brooch (attuned)\nConstant Companions:\nCharmed human male personal servants (x 4) that are sages/scribes, magic initiates (wizard). (She feeds on them occasionally, but she prefers fresh human males and she needs to feed daily.)\nPseudodragon familiar.\nSteel Defender.\nBloodforged Shield Guardian.\nStandard Practice Protections:\nShe has cast Mordenkainen’s Private Sanctum under her castle to protect her resting place which contains her personal laboratory, library, servant rooms, and feeding rooms. She cast Alarm on her resting place (coffin underneath the castle in a secret chamber within the sanctum). \nThe only door into the resting place has an arcane lock, mechanical lock, mechanical trap, and glyph of warding (Thunder). On her coffin, the lid has the spell Symbol cast on it, DC 23 to notice it. Trigger is the lid opening by anyone other than herself, the effect is “Death” doing 10d10 necrotic DC 23 Con save for half, in 60ft radius, to each target, each turn.\nShe casts Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound, and Tiny Servant with any unused 3rd and 4th level spell slots (potentially 6 servants) before resting each day and keeps them in the resting place while she rests. \n\n\nBefore Vampirism – The Lost Artificer of Amn\nBirth Name: Elspeth Varadin\nBackground: Amnian noblewoman, daughter of a powerful merchant house that specialized in enchanted wares and warforged exports.\nExpertise: A master of blood-bound artifice, developing life-infused constructs and arcane engines that blurred the line between life and machinery.\nDownfall:\nHer research was too valuable to simply outlaw or destroy. Instead, it sparked a vicious power struggle among Amnian merchant lords who sought to control or steal her discoveries.\nBetrayed by a former patron, she was forced to flee, vanishing into the lawless fringes of the Moonshaes.\nShe ended up in Snowdown, where she thought she could rebuild her work in secret.\n\nLady Erliza (formerly Elspeth Varadin)\nDescription (Human Life):\nElspeth Varadin was a woman whose presence was more often felt through her contraptions and innovations rather than her personal interactions. Quiet and introspective, Elspeth navigated social situations awkwardly, often appearing more comfortable amongst her mechanical inventions and arcane schematics than in conversation with her peers. Her piercing, intelligent eyes—deep emerald green—often glanced downward, rarely meeting the gaze of others directly, reflecting both her modesty and insecurity.\nDespite her social discomfort, Elspeth possessed a keen appreciation for elegance and beauty. While she never considered herself striking, she was meticulous in her attire, favoring intricately embroidered dresses in dark greens and deep blues accented with brass or silver adornments—practical yet refined, mirroring her approach to invention. Her dark brown hair, usually neatly bound in complex braids, was often streaked with soot or arcane residue from hours spent laboring over her latest contraptions.\nAs a master artificer, Elspeth’s inventions reflected her inner longing for perfection and grace. Her creations, ranging from simple yet beautiful clockwork automatons to elegantly shaped arcane tools, combined functionality with artistry. Her devices, powered by arcane cores or intricately crafted gears and enchanted runes, replicated spell effects through careful and precise mechanical construction. For instance, a “Shield” spell was generated by a wrist-mounted device that projected a translucent barrier, and “Levitate” was accomplished through delicate boots embedded with enchanted, mechanical pistons capable of brief elevation.\nWhile she admired beauty and grace in her designs, Elspeth was cautious not to augment herself directly. She saw herself as imperfect, yet hesitated at the idea of transforming her own body. Instead, she wore refined mechanical accessories that enhanced her natural abilities—bracers that improved her dexterity, a lens worn over one eye granting superior insight into her work, or gloves capable of minor magical manipulation. Her approach was always external augmentation, allowing her to maintain her fragile self-image intact.\nElspeth Varadin’s legacy as a human was defined by her exceptional skill in crafting minor magical items and elegant battle smith modifications. Her workshop was a testament to ingenuity, filled with objects that merged aesthetic elegance with precise functionality—an eternal reflection of her lifelong quest for perfection, grace, and mastery over the mechanical and arcane.\n",

Instead, it sparked a vicious power struggle among Amnian merchant lords who sought to control or steal her discoveries.\\nBetrayed by a former patron, she was forced to flee, vanishing into the lawless fringes of the Moonshaes.\\nShe ended up in Snowdown, where she thought she could rebuild her work in secret.\\n\\nLady Erliza (formerly Elspeth Varadin)\\nDescription (Human Life):\\nElspeth Varadin was a woman whose presence was more often felt through her contraptions and innovations rather than her personal interactions. Quiet and introspective, Elspeth navigated social situations awkwardly, often appearing more comfortable amongst her mechanical inventions and arcane schematics than in conversation with her peers. Her piercing, intelligent eyes—deep emerald green—often glanced downward, rarely meeting the gaze of others directly, reflecting both her modesty and insecurity.\\nDespite her social discomfort, Elspeth possessed a keen appreciation for elegance and beauty. While she never considered herself striking, she was meticulous in her attire, favoring intricately embroidered dresses in dark greens and deep blues accented with brass or silver adornments—practical yet refined, mirroring her approach to invention. Her dark brown hair, usually neatly bound in complex braids, was often streaked with soot or arcane residue from hours spent laboring over her latest contraptions.\\nAs a master artificer, Elspeth’s inventions reflected her inner longing for perfection and grace. Her creations, ranging from simple yet beautiful clockwork automatons to elegantly shaped arcane tools, combined functionality with artistry. Her devices, powered by arcane cores or intricately crafted gears and enchanted runes, replicated spell effects through careful and precise mechanical construction. For instance, a “Shield” spell was generated by a wrist-mounted device that projected a translucent barrier, and “Levitate” was accomplished through delicate boots embedded with enchanted, mechanical pistons capable of brief elevation.\\nWhile she admired beauty and grace in her designs, Elspeth was cautious not to augment herself directly. She saw herself as imperfect, yet hesitated at the idea of transforming her own body. Instead, she wore refined mechanical accessories that enhanced her natural abilities—bracers that improved her dexterity, a lens worn over one eye granting superior insight into her work, or gloves capable of minor magical manipulation. Her approach was always external augmentation, allowing her to maintain her fragile self-image intact.\\nElspeth Varadin’s legacy as a human was defined by her exceptional skill in crafting minor magical items and elegant battle smith modifications. Her workshop was a testament to ingenuity, filled with objects that merged aesthetic elegance with precise functionality—an eternal reflection of her lifelong quest for perfection, grace, and mastery over the mechanical and arcane.\\n\",\n  \"type\": \"npc\",\n  \"flags\": {\n    \"rule_base\": \"2024RAW\",\n    \"allow_invention\": \"cosmetic\",\n    \"tone\": \"epic\"\n  },\n

However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character.

Even then, the result is a lowly and ravenous vampire spawn.\\nVampires in D&D have fairly standard powers and weaknesses but to make them a little more interesting I have expanded beyond those “standard” vampires below.
