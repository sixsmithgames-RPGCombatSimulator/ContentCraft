South wall: 840 ft long, 60 ft high (coastal, sun and siege facing). You can picture the walls forming a big, slightly elongated rectangle.

South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space. North Ward (administration and quieter areas) The northern band of the castle, between the north curtain wall and the central keep, is mostly 200–250 ft deep. Vertical structure Ground level: courtyards, barracks, stables, service halls, main halls of the keep. First and second floors of the keep: great hall, feast chambers, council rooms, noble and vampire apartments. Third floor and spires: private sanctums, laboratories, and secure chambers. Below: castle storage, then the Bloodforge storage level, then the Bloodforge itself, then the mining line.\n",

Overall footprint Outer walls: about 1,040 ft (east–west) by 840 ft (north–south). Enclosed area: roughly 874,000 sq ft, just over 20 acres inside the walls. This comfortably holds multiple large internal wings, courtyards, and yards. Curtain walls East wall: 1,040 ft long, 70 ft high (taller for sunrise shade). West wall: 1,040 ft long, 45 ft high (mountains already give shade). North wall: 840 ft long, 45 ft high. South wall: 840 ft long, 60 ft high (coastal, sun and siege facing). You can picture the walls forming a big, slightly elongated rectangle. Think of the inside divided loosely into three east–west bands: north ward, central ward, south/industrial ward. Central keep base: about 360 ft (east–west) by 300 ft (north–south). It sits roughly in the middle of the castle, leaving wide courtyards on all sides. Central spire rises from its West Side, protruding about halfway from west wall of the keep,120+ ft tall. South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space. North Ward (administration and quieter areas) The northern band of the castle, between the north curtain wall and the central keep, is mostly 200–250 ft deep. Vertical structure Ground level: courtyards, barracks, stables, service halls, main halls of the keep. First and second floors of the keep: great hall, feast chambers, council rooms, noble and vampire apartments. Third floor and spires: private sanctums, laboratories, and secure chambers.

This comfortably holds multiple large internal wings, courtyards, and yards. Curtain walls East wall: 1,040 ft long, 70 ft high (taller for sunrise shade).

South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space. North Ward (administration and quieter areas) The northern band of the castle, between the north curtain wall and the central keep, is mostly 200–250 ft deep.

Central spire rises from its West Side, protruding about halfway from west wall of the keep,120+ ft tall. South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space. North Ward (administration and quieter areas) The northern band of the castle, between the north curtain wall and the central keep, is mostly 200–250 ft deep.

This comfortably holds multiple large internal wings, courtyards, and yards. Curtain walls East wall: 1,040 ft long, 70 ft high (taller for sunrise shade).

Central spire rises from its West Side, protruding about halfway from west wall of the keep,120+ ft tall. South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space. North Ward (administration and quieter areas) The northern band of the castle, between the north curtain wall and the central keep, is mostly 200–250 ft deep.

You are going to ensure consistency and dimensional alignment. The overview of each floor is below, I need you to start with the first floor of the castle at ground level. Overall footprint Outer walls: about 1,040 ft (east–west) by 840 ft (north–south). Enclosed area: roughly 874,000 sq ft, just over 20 acres inside the walls. This comfortably holds multiple large internal wings, courtyards, and yards. Curtain walls East wall: 1,040 ft long, 70 ft high (taller for sunrise shade). West wall: 1,040 ft long, 45 ft high (mountains already give shade). North wall: 840 ft long, 45 ft high. South wall: 840 ft long, 60 ft high (coastal, sun and siege facing). You can picture the walls forming a big, slightly elongated rectangle. Think of the inside divided loosely into three east–west bands: north ward, central ward, south/industrial ward. Central keep base: about 360 ft (east–west) by 300 ft (north–south). It sits roughly in the middle of the castle, leaving wide courtyards on all sides. Central spire rises from its West Side, protruding about halfway from west wall of the keep,120+ ft tall. South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space. North Ward (administration and quieter areas) The northern band of the castle, between the north curtain wall and the central keep, is mostly 200–250 ft deep. Vertical structure Ground level: courtyards, barracks, stables, service halls, main halls of the keep. First and second floors of the keep: great hall, feast chambers, council rooms, noble and vampire apartments. Third floor and spires: private sanctums, laboratories, and secure chambers.

Overall footprint Outer walls: about 1,040 ft (east–west) by 840 ft (north–south). Enclosed area: roughly 874,000 sq ft, just over 20 acres inside the walls. This comfortably holds multiple large internal wings, courtyards, and yards. Curtain walls East wall: 1,040 ft long, 70 ft high (taller for sunrise shade). West wall: 1,040 ft long, 45 ft high (mountains already give shade). North wall: 840 ft long, 45 ft high. South wall: 840 ft long, 60 ft high (coastal, sun and siege facing).

Central keep base: about 360 ft (east–west) by 300 ft (north–south). It sits roughly in the middle of the castle, leaving wide courtyards on all sides. Central spire rises from its West Side, protruding about halfway from west wall of the keep,120+ ft tall. South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space. North Ward (administration and quieter areas) The northern band of the castle, between the north curtain wall and the central keep, is mostly 200–250 ft deep. Vertical structure Ground level: courtyards, barracks, stables, service halls, main halls of the keep. First and second floors of the keep: great hall, feast chambers, council rooms, noble and vampire apartments. Third floor and spires: private sanctums, laboratories, and secure chambers.

Overall footprint Outer walls: about 1,040 ft (east–west) by 840 ft (north–south). Enclosed area: roughly 874,000 sq ft, just over 20 acres inside the walls. This comfortably holds multiple large internal wings, courtyards, and yards. Curtain walls East wall: 1,040 ft long, 70 ft high (taller for sunrise shade). West wall: 1,040 ft long, 45 ft high (mountains already give shade). North wall: 840 ft long, 45 ft high. South wall: 840 ft long, 60 ft high (coastal, sun and siege facing). You can picture the walls forming a big, slightly elongated rectangle. Think of the inside divided loosely into three east–west bands: north ward, central ward, south/industrial ward. Central keep base: about 360 ft (east–west) by 300 ft (north–south). It sits roughly in the middle of the castle, leaving wide courtyards on all sides. Central spire rises from its West Side, protruding about halfway from west wall of the keep,120+ ft tall. South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space. North Ward (administration and quieter areas) The northern band of the castle, between the north curtain wall and the central keep, is mostly 200–250 ft deep. Vertical structure Ground level: courtyards, barracks, stables, service halls, main halls of the keep. First and second floors of the keep: great hall, feast chambers, council rooms, noble and vampire apartments. Third floor and spires: private sanctums, laboratories, and secure chambers.

Overall footprint Outer walls: about 1,040 ft (east–west) by 840 ft (north–south). Enclosed area: roughly 874,000 sq ft, just over 20 acres inside the walls. This comfortably holds multiple large internal wings, courtyards, and yards. Curtain walls East wall: 1,040 ft long, 70 ft high (taller for sunrise shade). West wall: 1,040 ft long, 45 ft high (mountains already give shade). North wall: 840 ft long, 45 ft high. South wall: 840 ft long, 60 ft high (coastal, sun and siege facing). You can picture the walls forming a big, slightly elongated rectangle. Think of the inside divided loosely into three east–west bands: north ward, central ward, south/industrial ward. Central keep base: about 360 ft (east–west) by 300 ft (north–south). It sits roughly in the middle of the castle, leaving wide courtyards on all sides. Central spire rises from its West Side, protruding about halfway from west wall of the keep,120+ ft tall. South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space. North Ward (administration and quieter areas) The northern band of the castle, between the north curtain wall and the central keep, is mostly 200–250 ft deep. Vertical structure Ground level: courtyards, barracks, stables, service halls, main halls of the keep. First and second floors of the keep: great hall, feast chambers, council rooms, noble and vampire apartments. Third floor and spires: private sanctums, laboratories, and secure chambers.

This comfortably holds multiple large internal wings, courtyards, and yards. Curtain walls East wall: 1,040 ft long, 70 ft high (taller for sunrise shade).

Central spire rises from its West Side, protruding about halfway from west wall of the keep,120+ ft tall. South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space. North Ward (administration and quieter areas) The northern band of the castle, between the north curtain wall and the central keep, is mostly 200–250 ft deep.

This comfortably holds multiple large internal wings, courtyards, and yards. Curtain walls East wall: 1,040 ft long, 70 ft high (taller for sunrise shade).

Central spire rises from its West Side, protruding about halfway from west wall of the keep,120+ ft tall. South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space. North Ward (administration and quieter areas) The northern band of the castle, between the north curtain wall and the central keep, is mostly 200–250 ft deep.

First and second floors of the keep: great hall, feast chambers, council rooms, noble and vampire apartments. Third floor and spires: private sanctums, laboratories, and secure chambers.

South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space. North Ward (administration and quieter areas) The northern band of the castle, between the north curtain wall and the central keep, is mostly 200–250 ft deep.

It is often said that every stone laid was sealed with a drop of blood.\\n\\nThe original structure stood on the ruins of an ancient dwarven mine that Erliza co-opted for its rich iron veins. When she discovered the peculiar, sanguine qualities of the subterranean water and ore, the castle's purpose shifted. It became the seat of her new empire, dedicated to forging Blood-Steel and creating her terrible constructs. The towers and curtain walls serve as a massive, dark shell shielding the industrial core and the sensitive workings of the Bloodforge from prying eyes and the purifying sunlight.\",\n  \"current_events\": \"A massive, experimental construct—The **Iron Behemoth**—is currently being assembled on the lowest levels of the Bloodforge.

Commander Varkos is pushing his guards harder than ever, readying for an unknown, imminent deployment or invasion.

The sheer mass of the Keep dominates the western horizon, its towering stone face and spire an impossible feat of construction that seems to watch every step.\\n\\nMoving south, the atmosphere abruptly shifts as you enter the busy, chaotic **Southeast Mustering Yard (CBSF-G-SE01)**. Here, the grim military aesthetic gives way to logistical grime. The loud whinnying of horses and the shouts of thralls hauling supplies replace the silence of the courtyard. Dust and manure coat the ground, and the immense eastern wall looms, its 70-foot height cutting off the sunrise. The party observes soldiers inspecting wagons near the tethering posts and a sergeant drilling new recruits on the wooden scaffold.\\n\\nVenturing into the South Industrial Ward, the air grows thick with heat and the metallic tang of the Bloodforge. The **Winch House (CBSF-G-SW06)** is a terrifying sight: a soaring chamber where massive iron gears grind, turning a central spool that lowers colossal buckets into the earth. The whole building vibrates with the noise, and the deep red glow of the magical lighting makes the metallic blood smell feel palpable. The journey culminates as you press through the narrow **West Industrial Corridor (CBSF-G-SW07)**, eventually reaching the **Industrial Loading Yard (CBSF-G-SW08)**, where hoists and cranes stand ready, silhouetted against the western curtain wall, awaiting the next shipment of Blood-Steel from the depths.\"\n}",

      "history": "Castle Blood Forge was not built over centuries like most fortresses; it was raised in a single decade by Lady Erliza's magically accelerated labor force. Its unique, imposing architecture is a testament to her ruthless efficiency and dark magical power. The fortress was designed not to resist the siege engines of men, but to repel the divine light of the sun and contain the volatile alchemical and ritual processes happening beneath its foundations. It is often said that every stone laid was sealed with a drop of blood.\n\nThe original structure stood on the ruins of an ancient dwarven mine that Erliza co-opted for its rich iron veins. When she discovered the peculiar, sanguine qualities of the subterranean water and ore, the castle's purpose shifted. It became the seat of her new empire, dedicated to forging Blood-Steel and creating her terrible constructs. The towers and curtain walls serve as a massive, dark shell shielding the industrial core and the sensitive workings of the Bloodforge from prying eyes and the purifying sunlight.",
      "current_events": "A massive, experimental construct—The **Iron Behemoth**—is currently being assembled on the lowest levels of the Bloodforge. The industrial zone on the surface is working at triple capacity, causing frequent accidents and the erratic, loud operation of the winches (CBSF-G-SW06). Commander Varkos is pushing his guards harder than ever, readying for an unknown, imminent deployment or invasion. Rumors of a **critical component** needed for the Behemoth's completion—perhaps a holy relic or a specific living sacrifice—are circulating among the thralls and guards.",

      "cinematic_walkthrough": "The entry begins at the massive, shadowed **East Gatehouse**, guarded by grim-faced, iron-clad soldiers. Once through, the party steps onto the enormous **Main East Courtyard (CBSF-G-CE01)**. The space is vast and chilling, paved in dark basalt that drinks the light, making the clear day feel overcast. The sheer mass of the Keep dominates the western horizon, its towering stone face and spire an impossible feat of construction that seems to watch every step.\n\nMoving south, the atmosphere abruptly shifts as you enter the busy, chaotic **Southeast Mustering Yard (CBSF-G-SE01)**. Here, the grim military aesthetic gives way to logistical grime. The loud whinnying of horses and the shouts of thralls hauling supplies replace the silence of the courtyard. Dust and manure coat the ground, and the immense eastern wall looms, its 70-foot height cutting off the sunrise. The party observes soldiers inspecting wagons near the tethering posts and a sergeant drilling new recruits on the wooden scaffold.\n\nVenturing into the South Industrial Ward, the air grows thick with heat and the metallic tang of the Bloodforge. The **Winch House (CBSF-G-SW06)** is a terrifying sight: a soaring chamber where massive iron gears grind, turning a central spool that lowers colossal buckets into the earth. The whole building vibrates with the noise, and the deep red glow of the magical lighting makes the metallic blood smell feel palpable. The journey culminates as you press through the narrow **West Industrial Corridor (CBSF-G-SW07)**, eventually reaching the **Industrial Loading Yard (CBSF-G-SW08)**, where hoists and cranes stand ready, silhouetted against the western curtain wall, awaiting the next shipment of Blood-Steel from the depths."

        "history": "Castle Blood Forge was not built over centuries like most fortresses; it was raised in a single decade by Lady Erliza's magically accelerated labor force. Its unique, imposing architecture is a testament to her ruthless efficiency and dark magical power. The fortress was designed not to resist the siege engines of men, but to repel the divine light of the sun and contain the volatile alchemical and ritual processes happening beneath its foundations. It is often said that every stone laid was sealed with a drop of blood.\n\nThe original structure stood on the ruins of an ancient dwarven mine that Erliza co-opted for its rich iron veins. When she discovered the peculiar, sanguine qualities of the subterranean water and ore, the castle's purpose shifted. It became the seat of her new empire, dedicated to forging Blood-Steel and creating her terrible constructs. The towers and curtain walls serve as a massive, dark shell shielding the industrial core and the sensitive workings of the Bloodforge from prying eyes and the purifying sunlight.",

The industrial zone on the surface is working at triple capacity, causing frequent accidents and the erratic, loud operation of the winches (CBSF-G-SW06). Commander Varkos is pushing his guards harder than ever, readying for an unknown, imminent deployment or invasion. Rumors of a **critical component** needed for the Behemoth's completion—perhaps a holy relic or a specific living sacrifice—are circulating among the thralls and guards.",

Once through, the party steps onto the enormous **Main East Courtyard (CBSF-G-CE01)**. The space is vast and chilling, paved in dark basalt that drinks the light, making the clear day feel overcast. The sheer mass of the Keep dominates the western horizon, its towering stone face and spire an impossible feat of construction that seems to watch every step.\n\nMoving south, the atmosphere abruptly shifts as you enter the busy, chaotic **Southeast Mustering Yard (CBSF-G-SE01)**. Here, the grim military aesthetic gives way to logistical grime. The loud whinnying of horses and the shouts of thralls hauling supplies replace the silence of the courtyard. Dust and manure coat the ground, and the immense eastern wall looms, its 70-foot height cutting off the sunrise. The party observes soldiers inspecting wagons near the tethering posts and a sergeant drilling new recruits on the wooden scaffold.\n\nVenturing into the South Industrial Ward, the air grows thick with heat and the metallic tang of the Bloodforge. The **Winch House (CBSF-G-SW06)** is a terrifying sight: a soaring chamber where massive iron gears grind, turning a central spool that lowers colossal buckets into the earth. The whole building vibrates with the noise, and the deep red glow of the magical lighting makes the metallic blood smell feel palpable. The journey culminates as you press through the narrow **West Industrial Corridor (CBSF-G-SW07)**, eventually reaching the **Industrial Loading Yard (CBSF-G-SW08)**, where hoists and cranes stand ready, silhouetted against the western curtain wall, awaiting the next shipment of Blood-Steel from the depths."

Its unique, imposing architecture is a testament to her ruthless efficiency and dark magical power. The fortress was designed not to resist the siege engines of men, but to repel the divine light of the sun and contain the volatile alchemical and ritual processes happening beneath its foundations. It is often said that every stone laid was sealed with a drop of blood.\n\nThe original structure stood on the ruins of an ancient dwarven mine that Erliza co-opted for its rich iron veins. When she discovered the peculiar, sanguine qualities of the subterranean water and ore, the castle's purpose shifted. It became the seat of her new empire, dedicated to forging Blood-Steel and creating her terrible constructs. The towers and curtain walls serve as a massive, dark shell shielding the industrial core and the sensitive workings of the Bloodforge from prying eyes and the purifying sunlight.",

Commander Varkos is pushing his guards harder than ever, readying for an unknown, imminent deployment or invasion.
