The Steel Reaper is a hybrid construct and undead creature fueled by blood magic. It is resistant to effects that target only constructs or undead but is affected by effects that target either.\nBlood Infusions. The bloodsteel is infused with blood-based magic and powers some of its abilities.\nMagic Resistance. The Steel Reaper has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\nMagic Weapons. The Steel Reaper's weapon attacks are magical.\nActions\nMultiattack. The Steel Reaper makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its bloodsteel claws.\nBite. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d6 + 7) piercing damage plus 11 (3d6) necrotic damage. Heals damage equal to the necrotic damage it deals. Creatures bitten reduce their max HP by the necrotic damage dealt. Using a blood infusion which reduces its maximum hit points by 20, it can make the necrotic damage it dealt leave a permanent mark that allows the Steel Reaper to track (survival check) that creature anywhere as long as it is on the same plane and not protected from scrying.\nBloodsteel Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) slashing damage.\nDestructive Roar (Recharge 5+). The Steel Reaper takes 10 points of damage reducing its max HP as it uses its blood infusions and unleashes a horrifying roar in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (5d6) thunder and 18 (5d6) necrotic damage on a failed save and are knocked prone, or half as much on a successful one and are not prone.\nBonus Actions\nShadow Step (Recharge 5+). As a bonus action, the Steel Reaper can teleport up to 60 feet between areas of darkness or dim light it can see, appearing silently and gaining advantage on the first attack it makes immediately after teleporting.\nDetect. The Steel Reaper makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. If it previously wounded the target the roll is made with advantage.\nReactions\nBlood Frenzy. When the Steel Reaper is hit by an attack, it can use its reaction to enter into a frenzy until the end of its next turn. It takes 10 points of damage reducing its max HP as it uses its blood infusions. All attacks deal an extra 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, and all abilities it has recharge instantly.\nBloodsteel Claw. If a melee attack misses, the Steel Reaper makes one bloodsteel claw attack at the creature that missed.",

Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (5d6) thunder and 18 (5d6) necrotic damage on a failed save and are knocked prone, or half as much on a successful one and are not prone.\\nBonus Actions\\nShadow Step (Recharge 5+). As a bonus action, the Steel Reaper can teleport up to 60 feet between areas of darkness or dim light it can see, appearing silently and gaining advantage on the first attack it makes immediately after teleporting.\\nDetect. The Steel Reaper makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. If it previously wounded the target the roll is made with advantage.\\nReactions\\nBlood Frenzy. When the Steel Reaper is hit by an attack, it can use its reaction to enter into a frenzy until the end of its next turn. It takes 10 points of damage reducing its max HP as it uses its blood infusions. All attacks deal an extra 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, and all abilities it has recharge instantly.\\nBloodsteel Claw.
