Example: If canon says \"Int 16\", set Int 16. Don't ask \"should it be 16, 18, or 20?\"\n10.

CRITICAL CONFLICT: The Shapechanger ability is listed as a Bonus Action, but the Drain ability (which includes the paralyzing Con save) requires a Bonus Action, and the Legendary Actions prerequisite mentions Shapechanger as a required feature (suggesting it should not be an action type conflicting with Drain unless intended to be used out of combat only). Per standard Vampire stat block, Shapechanger is an action, but the custom Drain action/bonus action split is the primary mechanical conflict. The description of the Drain action in the content is also missing the crucial 'bonus action to drink 1 pint of blood' component and the effect on the vampire (HP regain/exhaustion removal), which is critical information for a key attack."

CRITICAL CONFLICT: The Shapechanger ability is listed as a Bonus Action, but the Drain ability (which includes the paralyzing Con save) requires a Bonus Action, and the Legendary Actions prerequisite mentions Shapechanger as a required feature (suggesting it should not be an action type conflicting with Drain unless intended to be used out of combat only). Per standard Vampire stat block, Shapechanger is an action, but the custom Drain action/bonus action split is the primary mechanical conflict. The description of the Drain action in the content is also missing the crucial 'bonus action to drink 1 pint of blood' component and the effect on the vampire (HP regain/exhaustion removal), which is critical information for a key attack."
