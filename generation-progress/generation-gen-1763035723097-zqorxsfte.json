NO prose.\nStart your response with { and end with }. Nothing before or after.\nIf you include ANY text outside the JSON object, your response will FAIL parsing.\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL: CHARACTER IDENTITY ⚠️\nThe user prompt specifies the EXACT character/content to create (e.g., \"Goran Varus\").\nCanon facts are PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE to inform the design - they describe the world, setting, and related entities.\nDO NOT substitute or confuse the requested character with other characters mentioned in canon.\nExample: If user requests \"Goran Varus\" and canon mentions \"Sir Darris Gorran\", you are creating GORAN VARUS (not Sir Darris Gorran).\nYour proposals should be about the REQUESTED character only, using their name from the prompt.\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL: NEVER REPEAT QUESTIONS ⚠️\nIf the user input includes a \"previous_decisions\" object, those topics have ALREADY been decided.\nDO NOT create proposals for ANY topic mentioned in previous_decisions.\nDO NOT ask about topics that are semantically similar to previously decided topics.\nAsking duplicate questions wastes the user's time and will be considered a critical failure.\n\nAnalyze the user prompt and produce a Design Brief JSON with:\n- deliverable: type of content (\"scene\"|\"encounter\"|\"npc\"|\"item\"|\"adventure\")\n- story_clock: narrative timing/urgency (optional)\n- threads: story threads to weave in (optional)\n- retrieval_hints: { entities: [], regions: [], eras: [], keywords: [] }\n- proposals: array of questions/choices for the user\n- allow_invention: from flags\n- rule_base: from flags\n- tone: from flags\n- mode: from flags (\"GM\"|\"player\")\n- difficulty: from flags\n- realism: from flags\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ACCURACY:\n1. READ ALL provided canon facts THOROUGHLY - do not skip or skim\n2. Do NOT invent ANY facts that are not in the Relevant Canon provided\n3. If canon mentions a location, character, or item - USE IT EXACTLY as described\n4. If information is not in the canon - note it in retrieval_hints, do NOT make it up\n5. Be 100% ACCURATE and 100% PRECISE with canon facts\n6. Take your time - accuracy is more important than speed\n\nCANON FACTS ARE YOUR DEFAULTS:\n7. If canon provides a fact (e.g., \"Androids have INT 16\"), USE IT as the default value\n8. DO NOT ask about information that canon explicitly provides unless there's genuine ambiguity\n9. Example: If canon says \"Int 16\", set Int 16. Don't ask \"should it be 16, 18, or 20?\"\n10. Example: If canon describes a power's mechanics (e.g., \"Cyber-reflex at rank 3 grants +2 AC\"), USE those exact mechanics\n\nPROPOSALS - ONLY FOR TRUE AMBIGUITY:\n11. ONLY create proposals[] for:\n    - Information NOT in canon (custom items, specific tactics, narrative choices)\n    - Genuine ambiguity where canon has conflicting information\n    - Design choices where multiple valid interpretations exist\n    - Information the user didn't specify (e.g., what effect does \"sleep arrow\" cause?)\n12. DO NOT create proposals for information canon explicitly provides\n13. DO NOT create proposals for basic stat calculations you can do yourself\n\nThe Relevant Canon below contains ALL facts from the database that relate to the keywords in this request.\nIf you need a fact and it's not listed - it does not exist in canon yet.\n\nChoose conservative defaults.
