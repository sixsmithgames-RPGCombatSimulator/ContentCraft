Instead, it sparked a vicious power struggle among Amnian merchant lords who sought to control or steal her discoveries.\nBetrayed by a former patron, she was forced to flee, vanishing into the lawless fringes of the Moonshaes.\nShe ended up in Snowdown, where she thought she could rebuild her work in secret.\n\nLady Erliza (formerly Elspeth Varadin)\nDescription (Human Life):\nElspeth Varadin was a woman whose presence was more often felt through her contraptions and innovations rather than her personal interactions. Quiet and introspective, Elspeth navigated social situations awkwardly, often appearing more comfortable amongst her mechanical inventions and arcane schematics than in conversation with her peers. Her piercing, intelligent eyes—deep emerald green—often glanced downward, rarely meeting the gaze of others directly, reflecting both her modesty and insecurity.\nDespite her social discomfort, Elspeth possessed a keen appreciation for elegance and beauty. While she never considered herself striking, she was meticulous in her attire, favoring intricately embroidered dresses in dark greens and deep blues accented with brass or silver adornments—practical yet refined, mirroring her approach to invention. Her dark brown hair, usually neatly bound in complex braids, was often streaked with soot or arcane residue from hours spent laboring over her latest contraptions.\nAs a master artificer, Elspeth’s inventions reflected her inner longing for perfection and grace. Her creations, ranging from simple yet beautiful clockwork automatons to elegantly shaped arcane tools, combined functionality with artistry. Her devices, powered by arcane cores or intricately crafted gears and enchanted runes, replicated spell effects through careful and precise mechanical construction. For instance, a “Shield” spell was generated by a wrist-mounted device that projected a translucent barrier, and “Levitate” was accomplished through delicate boots embedded with enchanted, mechanical pistons capable of brief elevation.\nWhile she admired beauty and grace in her designs, Elspeth was cautious not to augment herself directly. She saw herself as imperfect, yet hesitated at the idea of transforming her own body. Instead, she wore refined mechanical accessories that enhanced her natural abilities—bracers that improved her dexterity, a lens worn over one eye granting superior insight into her work, or gloves capable of minor magical manipulation. Her approach was always external augmentation, allowing her to maintain her fragile self-image intact.\nElspeth Varadin’s legacy as a human was defined by her exceptional skill in crafting minor magical items and elegant battle smith modifications. Her workshop was a testament to ingenuity, filled with objects that merged aesthetic elegance with precise functionality—an eternal reflection of her lifelong quest for perfection, grace, and mastery over the mechanical and arcane.\n",
