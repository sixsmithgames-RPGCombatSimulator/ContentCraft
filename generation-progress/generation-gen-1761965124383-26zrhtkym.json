However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character. The person is dead and an evil being (usually) that looks like them now stands in their place. Vampires are largely harsh, merciless, and without compunction. Their tormented souls are twisted in pain. They care not about their previous life or the people in it save using the knowledge and memories to help gain power.\\nBecoming a Vampire requires a couple of things 1) being bitten by a Vampire and 2) then being drained of all your hit points and then some (beyond zero) by a Vampire. Even then, the result is a lowly and ravenous vampire spawn.\\nVampires in D&D have fairly standard powers and weaknesses but to make them a little more interesting I have expanded beyond those “standard” vampires below.

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: Goran's ability scores are necessary to finalize his DCs and attack rolls. Given he is an Elven Arcane Archer/Fighter, what should his final **Dexterity** score be?\nA: **Option B (Maximized Archer):** Dex 20 (+5 modifier). This reflects his elite, disciplined archery focus, overriding the standard vampire template.\n\nQ: The canonical rules for **Celerity (L9)** provide two distinct ways the ability is recharged. Which rule should Goran Varus use?\nA: **Option A (General Rule):** Usable **Proficiency Bonus (PB) times per Long Rest** (5 uses/Long Rest).\n\nQ: The user-provided prompt previously contained a custom rule: using **Children of the Night** recharges his Arcane Shot uses. This rule is not in the canon. Should this custom recharge mechanism be kept or removed?\nA: **Remove Custom Rule:** Arcane Shot recharges only on a Short or Long Rest, per the standard Arcane Archer rule (L3). The Children of the Night feature provides summons only.\n\nQ: As a 9th-level Vampire, Goran possesses canonical natural weapons (**Claws** and **Bite**) and the ability to make a **Multiattack** (3 attacks). Should these canonical natural weapons be included in his stat block, or should he rely only on his weapons and daggers?\nA: **Include Natural Weapons:** Add the canonical Vampire **Bite (1d4+STR)**, **Claw (1d6+STR)**, and the 9th-level **Multiattack (3 attacks)**. (This provides a powerful close-quarters defense).\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array. These decisions are final and must not be re-asked.\n",

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: Goran's ability scores are necessary to finalize his DCs and attack rolls. Given he is an Elven Arcane Archer/Fighter, what should his final **Dexterity** score be?\nA: **Option B (Maximized Archer):** Dex 20 (+5 modifier). This reflects his elite, disciplined archery focus, overriding the standard vampire template.\n\nQ: The canonical rules for **Celerity (L9)** provide two distinct ways the ability is recharged. Which rule should Goran Varus use?\nA: **Option A (General Rule):** Usable **Proficiency Bonus (PB) times per Long Rest** (5 uses/Long Rest).\n\nQ: The user-provided prompt previously contained a custom rule: using **Children of the Night** recharges his Arcane Shot uses. This rule is not in the canon. Should this custom recharge mechanism be kept or removed?\nA: **Remove Custom Rule:** Arcane Shot recharges only on a Short or Long Rest, per the standard Arcane Archer rule (L3). The Children of the Night feature provides summons only.\n\nQ: As a 9th-level Vampire, Goran possesses canonical natural weapons (**Claws** and **Bite**) and the ability to make a **Multiattack** (3 attacks). Should these canonical natural weapons be included in his stat block, or should he rely only on his weapons and daggers?\nA: **Include Natural Weapons:** Add the canonical Vampire **Bite (1d4+STR)**, **Claw (1d6+STR)**, and the 9th-level **Multiattack (3 attacks)**. (This provides a powerful close-quarters defense).\n\nQ: Goran is a Fighter (medium armor proficient) and a Vampire (natural AC/speed bonus).

However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character.

Even then, the result is a lowly and ravenous vampire spawn.\\nVampires in D&D have fairly standard powers and weaknesses but to make them a little more interesting I have expanded beyond those “standard” vampires below.

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: Goran's ability scores are necessary to finalize his DCs and attack rolls. Given he is an Elven Arcane Archer/Fighter, what should his final **Dexterity** score be?\nA: **Option B (Maximized Archer):** Dex 20 (+5 modifier). This reflects his elite, disciplined archery focus, overriding the standard vampire template.\n\nQ: The canonical rules for **Celerity (L9)** provide two distinct ways the ability is recharged. Which rule should Goran Varus use?\nA: **Option A (General Rule):** Usable **Proficiency Bonus (PB) times per Long Rest** (5 uses/Long Rest).\n\nQ: The user-provided prompt previously contained a custom rule: using **Children of the Night** recharges his Arcane Shot uses. This rule is not in the canon. Should this custom recharge mechanism be kept or removed?\nA: **Remove Custom Rule:** Arcane Shot recharges only on a Short or Long Rest, per the standard Arcane Archer rule (L3). The Children of the Night feature provides summons only.\n\nQ: As a 9th-level Vampire, Goran possesses canonical natural weapons (**Claws** and **Bite**) and the ability to make a **Multiattack** (3 attacks). Should these canonical natural weapons be included in his stat block, or should he rely only on his weapons and daggers?\nA: **Include Natural Weapons:** Add the canonical Vampire **Bite (1d4+STR)**, **Claw (1d6+STR)**, and the 9th-level **Multiattack (3 attacks)**. (This provides a powerful close-quarters defense).\n\nQ: Goran is a Fighter (medium armor proficient) and a Vampire (natural AC/speed bonus). What is his base **Armor Class (AC)** and source?\nA: **AC 19:** Armored AC + Ring. (14 Leather + 4 Dex + 2 Physique + 1 Ring). Maximizes AC while maintaining speed, fitting his 'epic' tone.\n\nQ: What is Goran's final **Hit Points (HP)** value based on his 5 Fighter (d10) / 4 Vampire (d8) levels (9 HD total)?\nA: vampire hd is 9, not 4\n\nQ: The canonical rules for **Celerity (L9)** provide two distinct rules for recharging. Which rule should Goran Varus use?\nA: **Option A (General Rule):** Usable **Proficiency Bonus (PB) times per Long Rest** (5 uses/Long Rest).\n\nQ: The user prompt previously contained a custom rule: using **Children of the Night** recharges his Arcane Shot uses. This rule is not in the canon. Should this custom recharge mechanism be kept or removed?\nA: **Remove Custom Rule:** Arcane Shot recharges only on a Short or Long Rest, per the standard Arcane Archer rule (L3). The Children of the Night feature provides summons only.\n\nQ: Should the canonical Vampire **Multiattack** (3 attacks), **Claw**, and **Bite** be included to provide a powerful close-quarters defense, or should he rely only on his weapons and daggers?\nA: **Include Natural Weapons:** Add the canonical Vampire **Bite (1d4+STR)**, **Claw (1d6+STR)**, and the 9th-level **Multiattack (3 attacks)**.\n\nQ: What is the final list of Goran's **Saving Throw Proficiencies** (which determines his resilience against effects like Paralysis, Charm, and Fear)?\nA: **Option C (Combined):** Proficient in **Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma**.\n\nQ: The 'Expertise implied' text is non-canonical and unnecessary jargon, as the total modifier is derived from the standard Cha + PB (+4 + +4 = +8).\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The speed (40 ft.) is already defined in the main `npc.speed` field and is redundant here.\nA: Shorten to: 'Goran has advantage on Deception and Persuasion checks against onlookers who don’t fear them and haven’t been harmed by them,\n\nQ: 1. Saving Throw Proficiencies: What is the final list of Goran's **Saving Throw Proficiencies**?\nA: previously answered\n\nQ: 2. Acid Vulnerability Interaction: How does the **Energy Vulnerability-Acid** weakness interact with damage from holy/running water, which normally deals 10 acid damage to a vampire?\nA: previously answered\n\nQ: 3.

Charm CR Limit: The Blueblood Charm ability needs a mechanical limit. Up to what Challenge Rating (CR) creature can Goran Charm?\nA: 12\n\nQ: 5. Armor Class: What is Goran's base **Armor Class (AC)**? (Based on a decided DEX 20/+5, +1 Ring, and +1 Physique natural AC bonus).\nA: previously answered\n\nQ: 6. Hit Points: What is Goran's final **Hit Points (HP)** value based on his 5 Fighter (d10) / 4 Vampire (d8) levels (9 HD total)?\nA: previously answered, fighter 5 hd vampire 9 hd\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit (assuming 18 Dex), range 30 ft., two targets.\" at npc.actions.description\nA: Revise based on canon\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"This Charm affects any creature up to a CR of 9 (equal to his hit dice).\" at npc.actions.description\nA: previously answered, cr 12\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Goran takes **double damage** from acid, including running water (20 acid damage instead of 10) and Holy Water, and this damage cannot be reduced by magic or items.\" at npc.weaknesses.description\nA: Keep as-is\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"TBD values for proficiency list.\" at npc.saving_throws\nA: Revise based on canon\n\nQ: The 'Expertise implied' text is non-canonical jargon.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The speed detail is redundant as it is in the main speed field.\nA: Shorten to remove the redundant speed detail.\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array.

However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character.

Their tormented souls are twisted in pain. They care not about their previous life or the people in it save using the knowledge and memories to help gain power.\\nBecoming a Vampire requires a couple of things 1) being bitten by a Vampire and 2) then being drained of all your hit points and then some (beyond zero) by a Vampire.

What is his base **Armor Class (AC)** and source?\nA: **AC 19:** Armored AC + Ring. (14 Leather + 4 Dex + 2 Physique + 1 Ring). Maximizes AC while maintaining speed, fitting his 'epic' tone.\n\nQ: What is Goran's final **Hit Points (HP)** value based on his 5 Fighter (d10) / 4 Vampire (d8) levels (9 HD total)?\nA: vampire hd is 9, not 4\n\nQ: The canonical rules for **Celerity (L9)** provide two distinct rules for recharging. Which rule should Goran Varus use?\nA: **Option A (General Rule):** Usable **Proficiency Bonus (PB) times per Long Rest** (5 uses/Long Rest).\n\nQ: The user prompt previously contained a custom rule: using **Children of the Night** recharges his Arcane Shot uses.

Should this custom recharge mechanism be kept or removed?\nA: **Remove Custom Rule:** Arcane Shot recharges only on a Short or Long Rest, per the standard Arcane Archer rule (L3). The Children of the Night feature provides summons only.\n\nQ: Should the canonical Vampire **Multiattack** (3 attacks), **Claw**, and **Bite** be included to provide a powerful close-quarters defense, or should he rely only on his weapons and daggers?\nA: **Include Natural Weapons:** Add the canonical Vampire **Bite (1d4+STR)**, **Claw (1d6+STR)**, and the 9th-level **Multiattack (3 attacks)**.\n\nQ: What is the final list of Goran's **Saving Throw Proficiencies** (which determines his resilience against effects like Paralysis, Charm, and Fear)?\nA: **Option C (Combined):** Proficient in **Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma**.\n\nQ: The 'Expertise implied' text is non-canonical and unnecessary jargon, as the total modifier is derived from the standard Cha + PB (+4 + +4 = +8).\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The speed (40 ft.) is already defined in the main `npc.speed` field and is redundant here.\nA: Shorten to: 'Goran has advantage on Deception and Persuasion checks against onlookers who don’t fear them and haven’t been harmed by them,\n\nQ: 1. Saving Throw Proficiencies: What is the final list of Goran's **Saving Throw Proficiencies**?\nA: previously answered\n\nQ: 2. Acid Vulnerability Interaction: How does the **Energy Vulnerability-Acid** weakness interact with damage from holy/running water, which normally deals 10 acid damage to a vampire?\nA: previously answered\n\nQ: 3.

The 'Weakened Bonds' feature sets the limit to half his hit dice (4 spawn). This is a deliberate reduction in power via a custom Weakness, which is generally permissible for NPC customization, so it is marked as minor.\\n\\n2. Sire Domination: The canon states a Sire can impose an 8-hour Dominate Person-like effect up to HD times per night. The 'Weakened Bonds' feature states the domination is reduced to once per day for one hour.

However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character.

Even then, the result is a lowly and ravenous vampire spawn.\\nVampires in D&D have fairly standard powers and weaknesses but to make them a little more interesting I have expanded beyond those “standard” vampires below.

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: Goran's ability scores are necessary to finalize his DCs and attack rolls. Given he is an Elven Arcane Archer/Fighter, what should his final **Dexterity** score be?\nA: **Option B (Maximized Archer):** Dex 20 (+5 modifier). This reflects his elite, disciplined archery focus, overriding the standard vampire template.\n\nQ: The canonical rules for **Celerity (L9)** provide two distinct ways the ability is recharged. Which rule should Goran Varus use?\nA: **Option A (General Rule):** Usable **Proficiency Bonus (PB) times per Long Rest** (5 uses/Long Rest).\n\nQ: The user-provided prompt previously contained a custom rule: using **Children of the Night** recharges his Arcane Shot uses. This rule is not in the canon. Should this custom recharge mechanism be kept or removed?\nA: **Remove Custom Rule:** Arcane Shot recharges only on a Short or Long Rest, per the standard Arcane Archer rule (L3). The Children of the Night feature provides summons only.\n\nQ: As a 9th-level Vampire, Goran possesses canonical natural weapons (**Claws** and **Bite**) and the ability to make a **Multiattack** (3 attacks). Should these canonical natural weapons be included in his stat block, or should he rely only on his weapons and daggers?\nA: **Include Natural Weapons:** Add the canonical Vampire **Bite (1d4+STR)**, **Claw (1d6+STR)**, and the 9th-level **Multiattack (3 attacks)**. (This provides a powerful close-quarters defense).\n\nQ: Goran is a Fighter (medium armor proficient) and a Vampire (natural AC/speed bonus). What is his base **Armor Class (AC)** and source?\nA: **AC 19:** Armored AC + Ring. (14 Leather + 4 Dex + 2 Physique + 1 Ring). Maximizes AC while maintaining speed, fitting his 'epic' tone.\n\nQ: What is Goran's final **Hit Points (HP)** value based on his 5 Fighter (d10) / 4 Vampire (d8) levels (9 HD total)?\nA: vampire hd is 9, not 4\n\nQ: The canonical rules for **Celerity (L9)** provide two distinct rules for recharging. Which rule should Goran Varus use?\nA: **Option A (General Rule):** Usable **Proficiency Bonus (PB) times per Long Rest** (5 uses/Long Rest).\n\nQ: The user prompt previously contained a custom rule: using **Children of the Night** recharges his Arcane Shot uses.

Saving Throw Proficiencies: What is the final list of Goran's **Saving Throw Proficiencies**?\nA: previously answered\n\nQ: 2. Acid Vulnerability Interaction: How does the **Energy Vulnerability-Acid** weakness interact with damage from holy/running water, which normally deals 10 acid damage to a vampire?\nA: previously answered\n\nQ: 3.
