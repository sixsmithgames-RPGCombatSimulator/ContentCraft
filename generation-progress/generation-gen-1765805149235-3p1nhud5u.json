BONDS: Strongly bound to his father, King Derid Kendrick, and to the legacy of House Kendrick and Caer Callidyr; he also feels a quiet kinship with the druids of the Earthmother who shaped his upbringing. FLAWS: Tends to shoulder burdens alone, hesitant to delegate authority, and prone to self-doubt when facing threats that diplomacy may not resolve. GOALS: To preserve the unity of the Moonshaes, prove himself worthy of succession, and serve as a bridge between crown, people, and the Earthmother’s traditions. FEARS: That he will fail to live up to his father’s example, and that the growing Shadowfell threats may demand choices that compromise his ideals. QUIRKS: Frequently seeks solitude in the enchanted gardens of Caer Callidyr to reflect and steady himself when political pressures mount.
