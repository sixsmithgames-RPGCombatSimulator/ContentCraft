Why is an Archmage of his stature so involved in Moonshae politics?\\\"\\nKenthur Owen shifts uncomfortably and answers:\\n“Typhus is an immensely powerful figure—his motives are difficult to discern. Officially, his interest lies in preserving magical stability across the region, but politics influences his decisions more than pure neutrality. Our family’s growing influence threatened some within Typhus’s circle. Tudur's reckless experimentation with shadow magic provided just the excuse they needed. Now Typhus’s condemnation ensures our isolation.”\\nThe devil Typhus dealt with was a pit fiend of Levistus. The Ultimate Goal of Levistus: Levistus is trapped in the ice of Stygia. His goal in the Moonshaes is not just chaos, but Planar Resonance. By merging the Shadowfell, Feywild, and Material Plane, he aims to create a \\\"Tri-Planar Fracture.\\\" This fracture would cause a localized collapse of reality, a freezing void that mimics the conditions of his prison. This would allow him to project his full avatar into the Moonshaes—effectively \\\"breaking free\\\" into a new world because he cannot leave his current one.\\n\\nThe Real Cost to Typhus: Beyond his soul, the cost is \\\"The Rot of the Land.\\\" Typhus’s deal requires him to be the conduit for the infernal power. Every time he uses this power, a portion of the Earthmother’s influence in Alaron dies. He is literally becoming a \\\"Grave of the Earth\\\"—his physical body is slowly turning into cold, dead stone or ice, and the only way to stay \\\"alive\\\" is to complete the ritual and become the undying god-king Levistus promised.\\n\",\n  \"type\": \"npc\",\n  \"flags\": {\n    \"allow_invention\": \"cosmetic\",\n    \"tone\": \"epic\",\n    \"domain\": \"rpg\",\n    \"rule_base\": \"2024RAW\"\n  },\n  \"relevant_canon\": {\n    \"facts\": [\n      {\n        \"text\": \"The Prince of Alaron is held captive by Lady Erliza, with the threat of vampiric transformation if ransom is unpaid.\",\n        \"source\": \"Prince of Alaron\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"text\": \"Lady Erliza's agents abducted the King of Alaron's son and thwarted a rescue attempt to coerce economic concessions.\",\n        \"source\": \"Kidnapping of Alaron's prince\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"text\": \"Caer Callidyr is the royal seat of Alaron targeted by Erliza's ransom scheme via Snowdown's economic leverage.\",\n        \"source\": \"Caer Callidyr\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"text\": \"King Derid refused Erliza's ransom demands and sent a stealth rescue team that was lost.\",\n        \"source\": \"King Derid Kendrick\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}",

In reality, he is a living conduit for infernal power, his body slowly petrifying into a freezing tomb of stone and ice.

Underneath his heavy illusion magic, his skin is a mottled, greyish-white, feeling like cold granite. His limbs move with a stony stiffness, and frost crystals bloom from his joints. His eyes, though cloaked by magic, are actually solid spheres of pale blue ice that radiate a supernatural chill.",
      "background": "Once a respected protector of magical stability in Alaron, Typhus's fear of the chaos within the Moonshaes led him to a desperate pact with a pit fiend serving Levistus.

To secure his power, he allied his inner circle with Lady Erliza of Snowdown, utilizing the kidnapping of Alaron's prince to weaken King Derid Kendrick. He personally declared the edict against the Owen family, using Tudur's shadow magic as a convenient excuse to eliminate a growing political threat.",
