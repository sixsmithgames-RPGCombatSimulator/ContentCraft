When a vampire kills you, you die.

However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character. The person is dead and an evil being (usually) that looks like them now stands in their place. Vampires are largely harsh, merciless, and without compunction. Their tormented souls are twisted in pain. They care not about their previous life or the people in it save using the knowledge and memories to help gain power.\\nBecoming a Vampire requires a couple of things 1) being bitten by a Vampire and 2) then being drained of all your hit points and then some (beyond zero) by a Vampire. Even then, the result is a lowly and ravenous vampire spawn.\\nVampires in D&D have fairly standard powers and weaknesses but to make them a little more interesting I have expanded beyond those “standard” vampires below.
