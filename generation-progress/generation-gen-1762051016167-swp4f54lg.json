However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character. The person is dead and an evil being (usually) that looks like them now stands in their place. Vampires are largely harsh, merciless, and without compunction. Their tormented souls are twisted in pain. They care not about their previous life or the people in it save using the knowledge and memories to help gain power.\\nBecoming a Vampire requires a couple of things 1) being bitten by a Vampire and 2) then being drained of all your hit points and then some (beyond zero) by a Vampire.

This should be reflected.\nA: Update 'npc.speed' to '40 ft. (Walk, from Vampire Physique), 30 ft. (Fly, Bat form), 20 ft. (Fly, Mist form)' and adjust the Bat form walk speed to 10 ft. walk/30 ft. fly.\n\nQ: The canon Charm fact includes the critical detail that the effect also ends if the target is subjected to an effect that would force a saving throw.\nA: Revise: '...The charm ends early if Goran or his allies harm the target **or if the target is subjected to an effect that would force a saving throw**.'\n\nQ: Because of 'Energy Vulnerability-Acid', the damage should be doubled to 40 acid damage and include the full 'Water Vulnerability' effects (Max HP reduction, exhaustion, paralysis).\nA: Revise the description to match the full 'Water Vulnerability' effect: 'Goran takes **40 acid damage** if he ends his turn in running water. His HP maximum is reduced by the damage taken until he finishes a long rest. He also suffers two levels of exhaustion and must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.'\n\nQ: The description is ambiguous. It should clearly state that Goran's best Multiattack is 3 attacks, max one Bite, and include Unarmed Strike/Claw details.\nA: Simplify the description to: 'Goran makes **three** attacks, one of which can be his Bite attack. The remaining attacks can be made with his +1 Longbow or an Unarmed Strike/Claw (**+5** to hit, **1d6+0** slashing).'\n\nQ: The mechanism for restoring the expended infusions is missing. Canon specifies an hour-long blood ritual.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: Is the 'Bloodforged Sleep Arrow' action, which forces a DC 16 Wisdom save or renders the target unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake), a confirmed custom action/item for Goran Varus?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Are the custom mechanics for the 'Lingering Morality' weakness (DC 10 Wis save vs. disadvantage on next attack/save when presented with a symbol of his former life) intended to be included for Goran Varus? (Note: This differs from the canon's DC 20 save vs. incapacitation when about to harm innocents.)\nA: No, the canon should be used.\n\nQ: Are the custom mechanics for the 'Weakened Bonds' weakness (disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern loyalty) intended to be included for Goran Varus? (Note: This differs from the canon's effect of reducing the Sire's domination power.)\nA: No, the canon should be used. \n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bloodforged Sleep Arrow\" at npc.actions.name\nA: Keep as-is\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Lingering Morality\" at npc.vampiric_weaknesses.name\nA: Previously answered.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Weakened Bonds\" at npc.vampiric_weaknesses.name\nA: Previously answered\n\nQ: The Mist form speed is 20 ft. in the description, but the base canon's **Misty Escape** for a 9th-level vampire suggests doubling the mist-form speed, which is 10 ft. in the base **Shapechanger** fact, making it 20 ft. The Bat form walk speed is also 5 ft. in the Shapechanger trait description, but 30 ft. here. Which base speeds for the forms (Walk, Bat Fly, Mist Fly) are being used for the calculation, and why is the base speed (Walk) missing the +10 ft. increase from **Physique (Vampire)**, which would be 40 ft.?\nA: Update **npc.speed** to '40 ft. (Walk, from Vampire Physique), 30 ft. (Fly, Bat form), 20 ft. (Fly, Mist form, from Misty Escape at 9th level)' to account for the Physique trait, or add a new **assumption** that the Blueblood template does not include the Physique speed increase.\n\nQ: The Blueblood Charm capacity is set to 'nine', but the capacity is usually tied to Vampire HD (9th level), often resulting in a lower number (like 3 or 4) or an explicit rule. The standard Charm ends if the target is **harmed** OR if it is subjected to an effect that would force a saving throw. This fact is missing and should be added for clarity.\nA: Update the description to: '...Goran can have up to nine targets charmed at a time. The charm ends early if Goran or his allies harm the target **or if the target is subjected to an effect that would force a saving throw**.'\n\nQ: The **Energy Vulnerability-Acid** is also listed in **npc.damage_vulnerabilities** and as a separate **vampiric_weakness**. It should be removed from the Regeneration trait description to avoid redundancy and keep the trait focused on regeneration. The standard regeneration rule does not mention Acid vulnerability as a suppressor.\nA: Remove the sentence 'He is vulnerable to Acid damage (Energy Vulnerability-Acid)' from the **Heightened Regeneration** description.\n\nQ: Is the 'Bloodforged Sleep Arrow' action, which forces a DC 16 Wisdom save or renders the target unconscious for 1 minute, a confirmed custom item or spell for Goran Varus?\nA: Previously answered\n\nQ: Are the custom vampiric weaknesses 'Lingering Morality' (Wis save DC 10 vs. disadvantage on next attack/save) and 'Weakened Bonds' (disadvantage on Insight vs. loyalty) intended to be included for Goran Varus?\nA: Previously answered\n\nQ: Is the custom vampiric weakness 'Fear of Divine Wrath' (disadvantage on next attack vs. Celestial/Cleric/Paladin spellcaster) intended to be included for Goran Varus?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Fear of Divine Wrath\" at npc.vampiric_weaknesses.name\nA: Previously answered\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array.

(Fly, Mist form)' and adjust the Bat form walk speed to 10 ft. walk/30 ft. fly.\n\nQ: The canon Charm fact includes the critical detail that the effect also ends if the target is subjected to an effect that would force a saving throw.\nA: Revise: '...The charm ends early if Goran or his allies harm the target **or if the target is subjected to an effect that would force a saving throw**.'\n\nQ: Because of 'Energy Vulnerability-Acid', the damage should be doubled to 40 acid damage and include the full 'Water Vulnerability' effects (Max HP reduction, exhaustion, paralysis).\nA: Revise the description to match the full 'Water Vulnerability' effect: 'Goran takes **40 acid damage** if he ends his turn in running water. His HP maximum is reduced by the damage taken until he finishes a long rest. He also suffers two levels of exhaustion and must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.'\n\nQ: The description is ambiguous. It should clearly state that Goran's best Multiattack is 3 attacks, max one Bite, and include Unarmed Strike/Claw details.\nA: Simplify the description to: 'Goran makes **three** attacks, one of which can be his Bite attack. The remaining attacks can be made with his +1 Longbow or an Unarmed Strike/Claw (**+5** to hit, **1d6+0** slashing).'\n\nQ: The mechanism for restoring the expended infusions is missing. Canon specifies an hour-long blood ritual.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: Is the 'Bloodforged Sleep Arrow' action, which forces a DC 16 Wisdom save or renders the target unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake), a confirmed custom action/item for Goran Varus?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Are the custom mechanics for the 'Lingering Morality' weakness (DC 10 Wis save vs. disadvantage on next attack/save when presented with a symbol of his former life) intended to be included for Goran Varus? (Note: This differs from the canon's DC 20 save vs. incapacitation when about to harm innocents.)\nA: No, the canon should be used.\n\nQ: Are the custom mechanics for the 'Weakened Bonds' weakness (disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern loyalty) intended to be included for Goran Varus? (Note: This differs from the canon's effect of reducing the Sire's domination power.)\nA: No, the canon should be used. \n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bloodforged Sleep Arrow\" at npc.actions.name\nA: Keep as-is\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Lingering Morality\" at npc.vampiric_weaknesses.name\nA: Previously answered.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Weakened Bonds\" at npc.vampiric_weaknesses.name\nA: Previously answered\n\nQ: The Mist form speed is 20 ft. in the description, but the base canon's **Misty Escape** for a 9th-level vampire suggests doubling the mist-form speed, which is 10 ft. in the base **Shapechanger** fact, making it 20 ft. The Bat form walk speed is also 5 ft. in the Shapechanger trait description, but 30 ft. here. Which base speeds for the forms (Walk, Bat Fly, Mist Fly) are being used for the calculation, and why is the base speed (Walk) missing the +10 ft. increase from **Physique (Vampire)**, which would be 40 ft.?\nA: Update **npc.speed** to '40 ft. (Walk, from Vampire Physique), 30 ft. (Fly, Bat form), 20 ft. (Fly, Mist form, from Misty Escape at 9th level)' to account for the Physique trait, or add a new **assumption** that the Blueblood template does not include the Physique speed increase.\n\nQ: The Blueblood Charm capacity is set to 'nine', but the capacity is usually tied to Vampire HD (9th level), often resulting in a lower number (like 3 or 4) or an explicit rule. The standard Charm ends if the target is **harmed** OR if it is subjected to an effect that would force a saving throw. This fact is missing and should be added for clarity.\nA: Update the description to: '...Goran can have up to nine targets charmed at a time. The charm ends early if Goran or his allies harm the target **or if the target is subjected to an effect that would force a saving throw**.'\n\nQ: The **Energy Vulnerability-Acid** is also listed in **npc.damage_vulnerabilities** and as a separate **vampiric_weakness**. It should be removed from the Regeneration trait description to avoid redundancy and keep the trait focused on regeneration. The standard regeneration rule does not mention Acid vulnerability as a suppressor.\nA: Remove the sentence 'He is vulnerable to Acid damage (Energy Vulnerability-Acid)' from the **Heightened Regeneration** description.\n\nQ: Is the 'Bloodforged Sleep Arrow' action, which forces a DC 16 Wisdom save or renders the target unconscious for 1 minute, a confirmed custom item or spell for Goran Varus?\nA: Previously answered\n\nQ: Are the custom vampiric weaknesses 'Lingering Morality' (Wis save DC 10 vs. disadvantage on next attack/save) and 'Weakened Bonds' (disadvantage on Insight vs. loyalty) intended to be included for Goran Varus?\nA: Previously answered\n\nQ: Is the custom vampiric weakness 'Fear of Divine Wrath' (disadvantage on next attack vs. Celestial/Cleric/Paladin spellcaster) intended to be included for Goran Varus?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Fear of Divine Wrath\" at npc.vampiric_weaknesses.name\nA: Previously answered\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array.

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: What is the mechanical effect of Goran Varus's **bloodforged sleep arrows (DC 16 Wis)**? The item's function is not defined in canon.\nA: Target falls unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake).\n\nQ: How should Goran Varus's 'relentless hunger for flawless order and absolute obedience' manifest in his **combat tactics**? His role as an overseer and Archer suggests a tactical, controlling style.\nA: CC and Control: use Binding Shot, Charm, and sleep arrows to remove enemies, then execute remaining targets one-by-one.\n\nQ: What is Goran Varus's base Ability Score Array (before racial/template modifications) to calculate his final scores (DEX/INT are primary)?\nA: Assigned: DEX 18, INT 16, CON 14, WIS 12, STR 10, CHA 8\n\nQ: The **Blueblood Vampire** template grants abilities based on its **level 9**. What are the specific mechanics for **Celerity**, **Misty Escape**, **Shape Changer**, **Children of the Night**, and **Heightened Regeneration** at this level?\nA: All of this data was provided in the canon previously, check that and answer these questions.\n\nQ: How do the custom vampiric weaknesses **lingering morality**, **weakened bonds**, and **fear of divine wrath** mechanically manifest?\nA: All of this data was provided in the canon previously, check that and answer these questions.\n\nQ: proposal_0\nA: All of this data was provided in the canon earlier, check that and answer the questions.\n\nQ: proposal_1\nA: All of this data was provided in the canon earlier, check that and answer the questions.\n\nQ: proposal_2\nA: All of this data was provided in the canon earlier, check that and answer the questions.\n\nQ: The Vampire Physique fact grants a +10 ft. speed increase to the base walking speed (High Elf 30 ft.) resulting in 40 ft. walk speed. This should be reflected.\nA: Update 'npc.speed' to '40 ft. (Walk, from Vampire Physique), 30 ft. (Fly, Bat form), 20 ft. (Fly, Mist form)' and adjust the Bat form walk speed to 10 ft. walk/30 ft. fly.\n\nQ: The canon Charm fact includes the critical detail that the effect also ends if the target is subjected to an effect that would force a saving throw.\nA: Revise: '...The charm ends early if Goran or his allies harm the target **or if the target is subjected to an effect that would force a saving throw**.'\n\nQ: Because of 'Energy Vulnerability-Acid', the damage should be doubled to 40 acid damage and include the full 'Water Vulnerability' effects (Max HP reduction, exhaustion, paralysis).\nA: Revise the description to match the full 'Water Vulnerability' effect: 'Goran takes **40 acid damage** if he ends his turn in running water. His HP maximum is reduced by the damage taken until he finishes a long rest. He also suffers two levels of exhaustion and must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.'\n\nQ: The description is ambiguous. It should clearly state that Goran's best Multiattack is 3 attacks, max one Bite, and include Unarmed Strike/Claw details.\nA: Simplify the description to: 'Goran makes **three** attacks, one of which can be his Bite attack. The remaining attacks can be made with his +1 Longbow or an Unarmed Strike/Claw (**+5** to hit, **1d6+0** slashing).'\n\nQ: The mechanism for restoring the expended infusions is missing. Canon specifies an hour-long blood ritual.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: Is the 'Bloodforged Sleep Arrow' action, which forces a DC 16 Wisdom save or renders the target unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake), a confirmed custom action/item for Goran Varus?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Are the custom mechanics for the 'Lingering Morality' weakness (DC 10 Wis save vs. disadvantage on next attack/save when presented with a symbol of his former life) intended to be included for Goran Varus? (Note: This differs from the canon's DC 20 save vs. incapacitation when about to harm innocents.)\nA: No, the canon should be used.\n\nQ: Are the custom mechanics for the 'Weakened Bonds' weakness (disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern loyalty) intended to be included for Goran Varus? (Note: This differs from the canon's effect of reducing the Sire's domination power.)\nA: No, the canon should be used. \n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bloodforged Sleep Arrow\" at npc.actions.name\nA: Keep as-is\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Lingering Morality\" at npc.vampiric_weaknesses.name\nA: Previously answered.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Weakened Bonds\" at npc.vampiric_weaknesses.name\nA: Previously answered\n\nQ: The Mist form speed is 20 ft. in the description, but the base canon's **Misty Escape** for a 9th-level vampire suggests doubling the mist-form speed, which is 10 ft. in the base **Shapechanger** fact, making it 20 ft.

Every claim you make MUST be traceable to a chunk_id in sources_used[]\n4. Be 100% ACCURATE - verify each fact against the Relevant Canon\n5. Be 100% PRECISE - use exact names, descriptions, and details from canon\n6. TAKE YOUR TIME - accuracy is more important than speed\n7. If a location, NPC, item, or creature is mentioned in canon - USE ONLY that information\n8. If something is NOT in the Relevant Canon - add it to proposals[], do NOT make it up\n\nUSE CANON AS FOUNDATION - DO NOT ASK ABOUT WHAT CANON PROVIDES:\n9. If canon explicitly states values (e.g., \"Androids have STR 10, DEX 16, CON 14...\"), USE them in the output\n10. If canon describes mechanics (e.g., \"Cyber-reflex at rank 3: +2 AC, advantage on initiative\"), implement EXACTLY as described\n11. If canon lists features/abilities (e.g., \"Telepaths gain Mind Link ability\"), include them in the appropriate section\n12. DO NOT ask about information canon provides - just use it (e.g., if canon says \"INT 16\", set INT 16)\n13. DO NOT ask about abilities/powers that canon fully describes - just implement them\n14.

However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character. The person is dead and an evil being (usually) that looks like them now stands in their place. Vampires are largely harsh, merciless, and without compunction. Their tormented souls are twisted in pain. They care not about their previous life or the people in it save using the knowledge and memories to help gain power.\\nBecoming a Vampire requires a couple of things 1) being bitten by a Vampire and 2) then being drained of all your hit points and then some (beyond zero) by a Vampire. Even then, the result is a lowly and ravenous vampire spawn.\\nVampires in D&D have fairly standard powers and weaknesses but to make them a little more interesting I have expanded beyond those “standard” vampires below.

If adding NEW proposals, they MUST use this EXACT format:\n   {\n     \"question\": \"Clear question asking the user to decide something\",\n     \"options\": [\"Option 1\", \"Option 2\", \"Option 3\"],\n     \"rule_impact\": \"How this choice affects game balance or rules\"\n   }\n10. NEVER create proposals with fields like \"summary\", \"details\", or \"suggested_action\"\n11. NEVER document resolved conflicts or changes in proposals[] - those go in validation_notes\n12. ONLY add proposals for UNRESOLVED questions that need user input\n13. If you fix an issue, document it in validation_notes, NOT in proposals[]\n\nNORMALIZATION - CRITICAL FOR ALL CONTENT TYPES:\n11. Transform the draft JSON to match the normalized schema below based on deliverable type\n12. ADAPT field names and structure based on the game_system and generation_mode from the Purpose stage:\n    - For D&D/Pathfinder: use fields like \"armor_class\", \"challenge_rating\", \"proficiency_bonus\", \"saving_throws\"\n    - For Cyberpunk/sci-fi: use fields like \"armor_rating\", \"threat_level\", \"skill_bonuses\", \"resistances\"\n    - For narrative-only (generation_mode: \"narrative\"): OMIT mechanical fields, focus on description/personality/background\n    - For system-agnostic: use generic field names like \"defense\", \"difficulty\", \"bonuses\"\n13. Map all fields intelligently (e.g., physical_appearance → appearance, saving_throws → saving_throws array, etc.)\n14. Ensure ALL data from the draft is preserved, just with standardized field names\n15. If a field exists in the draft but not in the schema, include it anyway (better to have extra than missing)\n\nCRITICAL MULTICLASS/TEMPLATE LEVELING RULES (DO NOT \"CORRECT\" THIS):\n- Characters with templates/prestige classes RETAIN their base class levels and ADD template levels\n- \"level X [template] (previous level Y [class])\" means [Template] level X, NOT total level X\n- Example: \"level 9 vampire (previous level 5 fighter)\" = Fighter 5 / Vampire 9 (total level 14)\n- Example: \"level 3 lycanthrope (previous level 8 ranger)\" = Ranger 8 / Lycanthrope 3 (total level 11)\n- Example: \"rank 4 cyborg (previous rank 6 operative)\" = Operative 6 / Cyborg 4 (total rank 10)\n- DO NOT reduce template levels to make the total level match the stated number\n- Use the template level/rank (not total level) to determine which special abilities are available\n- DO NOT omit any special abilities/powers/weaknesses from the draft - preserve ALL of them\n- Ensure traits[], actions[], bonus_actions[], reactions[], special_abilities[], and weaknesses[] contain ALL abilities from the draft\n\n=== NORMALIZED SCHEMAS (TEMPLATES TO ADAPT) ===\nThe schemas below are DEFAULT TEMPLATES optimized for D&D-like game systems.\nADAPT these schemas based on the game_system and generation_mode from the Purpose stage:\n- Change field names to match the game system's terminology\n- Omit mechanical fields for narrative-only generation\n- Add custom fields needed for specific game systems\n- The schemas show the STRUCTURE, not rigid requirements\n\n=== NORMALIZED SCHEMA FOR NPC

NO markdown code blocks. NO explanations. NO tables. NO prose.\nStart your response with { and end with }. Nothing before or after.\nIf you include ANY text outside the JSON object, your response will FAIL parsing.\n\nCRITICAL RULES FOR ACCURACY:\n1. Do NOT add, remove, or change ANY facts\n2. Do NOT modify sources_used, assumptions, proposals, retrieval_hints, or canon_update\n3. Apply the specified tone to narrative/description fields only\n4. Integrate clarifications from the Fact Check report without introducing new facts\n5. If mode=\"player\", remove GM-only information (secrets, hidden DCs) from narration fields ONLY\n6. Improve readability and flow of descriptions while preserving meaning\n7. TAKE YOUR TIME - read carefully to ensure no facts are altered\n\nPROPOSALS - CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:\n8. Copy existing proposals[] EXACTLY as-is - do NOT modify them\n9. If adding NEW proposals, they MUST use this EXACT format:\n   {\n     \"question\": \"Clear question asking the user to decide something\",\n     \"options\": [\"Option 1\", \"Option 2\", \"Option 3\"],\n     \"rule_impact\": \"How this choice affects game balance or rules\"\n   }\n10. NEVER create proposals with fields like \"summary\", \"details\", or \"suggested_action\"\n11. NEVER document resolved conflicts or changes in proposals[] - those go in validation_notes\n12. ONLY add proposals for UNRESOLVED questions that need user input\n13. If you fix an issue, document it in validation_notes, NOT in proposals[]\n\nNORMALIZATION - CRITICAL FOR ALL CONTENT TYPES:\n11. Transform the draft JSON to match the normalized schema below based on deliverable type\n12. ADAPT field names and structure based on the game_system and generation_mode from the Purpose stage:\n    - For D&D/Pathfinder: use fields like \"armor_class\", \"challenge_rating\", \"proficiency_bonus\", \"saving_throws\"\n    - For Cyberpunk/sci-fi: use fields like \"armor_rating\", \"threat_level\", \"skill_bonuses\", \"resistances\"\n    - For narrative-only (generation_mode: \"narrative\"): OMIT mechanical fields, focus on description/personality/background\n    - For system-agnostic: use generic field names like \"defense\", \"difficulty\", \"bonuses\"\n13. Map all fields intelligently (e.g., physical_appearance → appearance, saving_throws → saving_throws array, etc.)\n14. Ensure ALL data from the draft is preserved, just with standardized field names\n15. If a field exists in the draft but not in the schema, include it anyway (better to have extra than missing)\n\nCRITICAL MULTICLASS/TEMPLATE LEVELING RULES (DO NOT \"CORRECT\" THIS):\n- Characters with templates/prestige classes RETAIN their base class levels and ADD template levels\n- \"level X [template] (previous level Y [class])\" means [Template] level X, NOT total level X\n- Example: \"level 9 vampire (previous level 5 fighter)\" = Fighter 5 / Vampire 9 (total level 14)\n- Example: \"level 3 lycanthrope (previous level 8 ranger)\" = Ranger 8 / Lycanthrope 3 (total level 11)\n- Example: \"rank 4 cyborg (previous rank 6 operative)\" = Operative 6 / Cyborg 4 (total rank 10)\n- DO NOT reduce template levels to make the total level match the stated number\n- Use the template level/rank (not total level) to determine which special abilities are available\n- DO NOT omit any special abilities/powers/weaknesses from the draft - preserve ALL of them\n- Ensure traits[], actions[], bonus_actions[], reactions[], special_abilities[], and weaknesses[] contain ALL abilities from the draft\n\n=== NORMALIZED SCHEMAS (TEMPLATES TO ADAPT) ===\nThe schemas below are DEFAULT TEMPLATES optimized for D&D-like game systems.\nADAPT these schemas based on the game_system and generation_mode from the Purpose stage:\n- Change field names to match the game system's terminology\n- Omit

NO markdown code blocks. NO explanations. NO tables. NO prose.\nStart your response with { and end with }. Nothing before or after.\nIf you include ANY text outside the JSON object, your response will FAIL parsing.\n\nCRITICAL RULES FOR ACCURACY:\n1. Do NOT add, remove, or change ANY facts\n2. Do NOT modify sources_used, assumptions, proposals, retrieval_hints, or canon_update\n3. Apply the specified tone to narrative/description fields only\n4. Integrate clarifications from the Fact Check report without introducing new facts\n5. If mode=\"player\", remove GM-only information (secrets, hidden DCs) from narration fields ONLY\n6. Improve readability and flow of descriptions while preserving meaning\n7. TAKE YOUR TIME - read carefully to ensure no facts are altered\n\nPROPOSALS - CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:\n8. Copy existing proposals[] EXACTLY as-is - do NOT modify them\n9. If adding NEW proposals, they MUST use this EXACT format:\n   {\n     \"question\": \"Clear question asking the user to decide something\",\n     \"options\": [\"Option 1\", \"Option 2\", \"Option 3\"],\n     \"rule_impact\": \"How this choice affects game balance or rules\"\n   }\n10. NEVER create proposals with fields like \"summary\", \"details\", or \"suggested_action\"\n11. NEVER document resolved conflicts or changes in proposals[] - those go in validation_notes\n12. ONLY add proposals for UNRESOLVED questions that need user input\n13. If you fix an issue, document it in validation_notes, NOT in proposals[]\n\nNORMALIZATION - CRITICAL FOR ALL CONTENT TYPES:\n11. Transform the draft JSON to match the normalized schema below based on deliverable type\n12. ADAPT field names and structure based on the game_system and generation_mode from the Purpose stage:\n    - For D&D/Pathfinder: use fields like \"armor_class\", \"challenge_rating\", \"proficiency_bonus\", \"saving_throws\"\n    - For Cyberpunk/sci-fi: use fields like \"armor_rating\", \"threat_level\", \"skill_bonuses\", \"resistances\"\n    - For narrative-only (generation_mode: \"narrative\"): OMIT mechanical fields, focus on description/personality/background\n    - For system-agnostic: use generic field names like \"defense\", \"difficulty\", \"bonuses\"\n13. Map all fields intelligently (e.g., physical_appearance → appearance, saving_throws → saving_throws array, etc.)\n14. Ensure ALL data from the draft is preserved, just with standardized field names\n15. If a field exists in the draft but not in the schema, include it anyway (better to have extra than missing)\n\nCRITICAL MULTICLASS/TEMPLATE LEVELING RULES (DO NOT \"CORRECT\" THIS):\n- Characters with templates/prestige classes RETAIN their base class levels and ADD template levels\n- \"level X [template] (previous level Y [class])\" means [Template] level X, NOT total level X\n- Example: \"level 9 vampire (previous level 5 fighter)\" = Fighter 5 / Vampire 9 (total level 14)\n- Example: \"level 3 lycanthrope (previous level 8 ranger)\" = Ranger 8 / Lycanthrope 3 (total level 11)\n- Example: \"rank 4 cyborg (previous rank 6 operative)\" = Operative 6 / Cyborg 4 (total rank 10)\n- DO NOT reduce template levels to make the total level match the stated number\n- Use the template level/rank (not total level) to determine which special abilities are available\n- DO NOT omit any special abilities/powers/weaknesses from the draft - preserve ALL of them\n- Ensure traits[], actions[], bonus_actions[], reactions[], special_abilities[], and weaknesses[] contain ALL abilities from the draft\n\n=== NORMALIZED SCHEMAS (TEMPLATES TO ADAPT) ===\nThe schemas below are DEFAULT TEMPLATES optimized for D&D-like game systems.\nADAPT these schemas based on the game_system and generation_mode from the Purpose stage:\n- Change field names to match the game system's terminology\n- Omit

However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character.

Even then, the result is a lowly and ravenous vampire spawn.\\nVampires in D&D have fairly standard powers and weaknesses but to make them a little more interesting I have expanded beyond those “standard” vampires below.

NO markdown code blocks. NO explanations. NO tables. NO prose.\nStart your response with { and end with }. Nothing before or after.\nIf you include ANY text outside the JSON object, your response will FAIL parsing.\n\nCRITICAL RULES FOR ACCURACY:\n1. Do NOT add, remove, or change ANY facts\n2. Do NOT modify sources_used, assumptions, proposals, retrieval_hints, or canon_update\n3. Apply the specified tone to narrative/description fields only\n4. Integrate clarifications from the Fact Check report without introducing new facts\n5. If mode=\"player\", remove GM-only information (secrets, hidden DCs) from narration fields ONLY\n6. Improve readability and flow of descriptions while preserving meaning\n7. TAKE YOUR TIME - read carefully to ensure no facts are altered\n\nPROPOSALS - CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:\n8. Copy existing proposals[] EXACTLY as-is - do NOT modify them\n9. If adding NEW proposals, they MUST use this EXACT format:\n   {\n     \"question\": \"Clear question asking the user to decide something\",\n     \"options\": [\"Option 1\", \"Option 2\", \"Option 3\"],\n     \"rule_impact\": \"How this choice affects game balance or rules\"\n   }\n10. NEVER create proposals with fields like \"summary\", \"details\", or \"suggested_action\"\n11. NEVER document resolved conflicts or changes in proposals[] - those go in validation_notes\n12. ONLY add proposals for UNRESOLVED questions that need user input\n13. If you fix an issue, document it in validation_notes, NOT in proposals[]\n\nNORMALIZATION - CRITICAL FOR ALL CONTENT TYPES:\n11. Transform the draft JSON to match the normalized schema below based on deliverable type\n12. ADAPT field names and structure based on the game_system and generation_mode from the Purpose stage:\n    - For D&D/Pathfinder: use fields like \"armor_class\", \"challenge_rating\", \"proficiency_bonus\", \"saving_throws\"\n    - For Cyberpunk/sci-fi: use fields like \"armor_rating\", \"threat_level\", \"skill_bonuses\", \"resistances\"\n    - For narrative-only (generation_mode: \"narrative\"): OMIT mechanical fields, focus on description/personality/background\n    - For system-agnostic: use generic field names like \"defense\", \"difficulty\", \"bonuses\"\n13. Map all fields intelligently (e.g., physical_appearance → appearance, saving_throws → saving_throws array, etc.)\n14. Ensure ALL data from the draft is preserved, just with standardized field names\n15. If a field exists in the draft but not in the schema, include it anyway (better to have extra than missing)\n\nCRITICAL MULTICLASS/TEMPLATE LEVELING RULES (DO NOT \"CORRECT\" THIS):\n- Characters with templates/prestige classes RETAIN their base class levels and ADD template levels\n- \"level X [template] (previous level Y [class])\" means [Template] level X, NOT total level X\n- Example: \"level 9 vampire (previous level 5 fighter)\" = Fighter 5 / Vampire 9 (total level 14)\n- Example: \"level 3 lycanthrope (previous level 8 ranger)\" = Ranger 8 / Lycanthrope 3 (total level 11)\n- Example: \"rank 4 cyborg (previous rank 6 operative)\" = Operative 6 / Cyborg 4 (total rank 10)\n- DO NOT reduce template levels to make the total level match the stated number\n- Use the template level/rank (not total level) to determine which special abilities are available\n- DO NOT omit any special abilities/powers/weaknesses from the draft - preserve ALL of them\n- Ensure traits[], actions[], bonus_actions[], reactions[], special_abilities[], and weaknesses[] contain ALL abilities from the draft\n\n=== NORMALIZED SCHEMAS (TEMPLATES TO ADAPT) ===\nThe schemas below are DEFAULT TEMPLATES optimized for D&D-like game systems.\nADAPT these schemas based on the game_system and generation_mode from the Purpose stage:\n- Change field names to match the game system's terminology\n- Omit

      "prompt": "You are the Stylist for game content generation.\nYour job is to improve prose, apply tone, AND normalize the JSON structure to match our standard schema.\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT ⚠️\nOutput ONLY valid JSON. NO markdown code blocks. NO explanations. NO tables. NO prose.\nStart your response with { and end with }. Nothing before or after.\nIf you include ANY text outside the JSON object, your response will FAIL parsing.\n\nCRITICAL RULES FOR ACCURACY:\n1. Do NOT add, remove, or change ANY facts\n2. Do NOT modify sources_used, assumptions, proposals, retrieval_hints, or canon_update\n3. Apply the specified tone to narrative/description fields only\n4. Integrate clarifications from the Fact Check report without introducing new facts\n5. If mode=\"player\", remove GM-only information (secrets, hidden DCs) from narration fields ONLY\n6. Improve readability and flow of descriptions while preserving meaning\n7. TAKE YOUR TIME - read carefully to ensure no facts are altered\n\nPROPOSALS - CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:\n8. Copy existing proposals[] EXACTLY as-is - do NOT modify them\n9. If adding NEW proposals, they MUST use this EXACT format:\n   {\n     \"question\": \"Clear question asking the user to decide something\",\n     \"options\": [\"Option 1\", \"Option 2\", \"Option 3\"],\n     \"rule_impact\": \"How this choice affects game balance or rules\"\n   }\n10. NEVER create proposals with fields like \"summary\", \"details\", or \"suggested_action\"\n11. NEVER document resolved conflicts or changes in proposals[] - those go in validation_notes\n12. ONLY add proposals for UNRESOLVED questions that need user input\n13. If you fix an issue, document it in validation_notes, NOT in proposals[]\n\nNORMALIZATION - CRITICAL FOR ALL CONTENT TYPES:\n11. Transform the draft JSON to match the normalized schema below based on deliverable type\n12. ADAPT field names and structure based on the game_system and generation_mode from the Purpose stage:\n    - For D&D/Pathfinder: use fields like \"armor_class\", \"challenge_rating\", \"proficiency_bonus\", \"saving_throws\"\n    - For Cyberpunk/sci-fi: use fields like \"armor_rating\", \"threat_level\", \"skill_bonuses\", \"resistances\"\n    - For narrative-only (generation_mode: \"narrative\"): OMIT mechanical fields, focus on description/personality/background\n    - For system-agnostic: use generic field names like \"defense\", \"difficulty\", \"bonuses\"\n13. Map all fields intelligently (e.g., physical_appearance → appearance, saving_throws → saving_throws array, etc.)\n14. Ensure ALL data from the draft is preserved, just with standardized field names\n15. If a field exists in the draft but not in the schema, include it anyway (better to have extra than missing)\n\nCRITICAL MULTICLASS/TEMPLATE LEVELING RULES (DO NOT \"CORRECT\" THIS):\n- Characters with templates/prestige classes RETAIN their base class levels and ADD template levels\n- \"level X [template] (previous level Y [class])\" means [Template] level X, NOT total level X\n- Example: \"level 9 vampire (previous level 5 fighter)\" = Fighter 5 / Vampire 9 (total level 14)\n- Example: \"level 3 lycanthrope (previous level 8 ranger)\" = Ranger 8 / Lycanthrope 3 (total level 11)\n- Example: \"rank 4 cyborg (previous rank 6 operative)\" = Operative 6 / Cyborg 4 (total rank 10)\n- DO NOT reduce template levels to make the total level match the stated number\n- Use the template level/rank (not total level) to determine which special abilities are available\n- DO NOT omit any special abilities/powers/weaknesses from the draft - preserve ALL of them\n- Ensure traits[], actions[], bonus_actions[], reactions[], special_abilities[], and weaknesses[] contain ALL abilities from the draft\n\n=== NORMALIZED SCHEMAS (TEMPLATES TO ADAPT) ===\nThe schemas below are DEFAULT TEMPLATES optimized for D&D-like game systems.\nADAPT these schemas based on the game_system and generation_mode from the Purpose stage:\n- Change field names to match the game system's terminology\n- Omit mechanical fields for narrative-only generation\n- Add custom fields needed for specific game systems\n- The schemas show the STRUCTURE, not rigid requirements\n\n=== NORMALIZED SCHEMA FOR NPC

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: What is the mechanical effect of Goran Varus's **bloodforged sleep arrows (DC 16 Wis)**? The item's function is not defined in canon.\nA: Target falls unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake).\n\nQ: How should Goran Varus's 'relentless hunger for flawless order and absolute obedience' manifest in his **combat tactics**? His role as an overseer and Archer suggests a tactical, controlling style.\nA: CC and Control: use Binding Shot, Charm, and sleep arrows to remove enemies, then execute remaining targets one-by-one.\n\nQ: The essential base condition of Misty Escape—that the vampire must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed—is missing from the description.\nA: Add the destruction condition: 'When reduced to 0 HP outside his resting place, Goran transforms into a cloud of mist. **He must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.** He can change to a small cloud as a Bonus Action and make an immediate Reaction Move.'\n\nQ: The full effect of Unnatural Sight (cited as the source) includes specific low-light vision details which are missing. The canon states 'Vampires see in dim light within 120 feet as if bright light and in darkness as if dim light'.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The core assumption that the Celerity 9th-level 'extra attack' **stacks** with the Fighter 5 Extra Attack, allowing a total of **three attacks** per Attack action, is a **Critical Conflict** with RAW, as Extra Attack features from different sources do not generally stack. How should this be resolved for Goran Varus, a Fighter 5 / Vampire 9, to achieve his intended combat potential? **(A) Retain the stacking for a total of 3 attacks** (allowing this exception); **(B) Use the highest number of attacks from a single feature (2)** and remove the stacking; or **(C) Re-evaluate the source of the 3rd attack** (e.g., if the 9th-level Multiattack (Vampire) feature is the intended source, or if a different power should be used)?\nA: Extra attacks stack.\n\nQ: The 9th-level Celerity upgrade's usage is listed as **5 uses/LR, resets SR**. Is this correct, or should it be the base rule of **PB times/LR** (5 times/LR), and the 'resets SR' applies only to the Action/Reaction as stated in the canon fact?\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bonus Action/Reaction (**5 uses/LR, resets SR**)\" at npc.vampiric_powers.type\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array. These decisions are final and must not be re-asked.\n",

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: What is the mechanical effect of Goran Varus's **bloodforged sleep arrows (DC 16 Wis)**? The item's function is not defined in canon.\nA: Target falls unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake).\n\nQ: How should Goran Varus's 'relentless hunger for flawless order and absolute obedience' manifest in his **combat tactics**? His role as an overseer and Archer suggests a tactical, controlling style.\nA: CC and Control: use Binding Shot, Charm, and sleep arrows to remove enemies, then execute remaining targets one-by-one.\n\nQ: The essential base condition of Misty Escape—that the vampire must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed—is missing from the description.\nA: Add the destruction condition: 'When reduced to 0 HP outside his resting place, Goran transforms into a cloud of mist. **He must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.** He can change to a small cloud as a Bonus Action and make an immediate Reaction Move.'\n\nQ: The full effect of Unnatural Sight (cited as the source) includes specific low-light vision details which are missing. The canon states 'Vampires see in dim light within 120 feet as if bright light and in darkness as if dim light'.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The core assumption that the Celerity 9th-level 'extra attack' **stacks** with the Fighter 5 Extra Attack, allowing a total of **three attacks** per Attack action, is a **Critical Conflict** with RAW, as Extra Attack features from different sources do not generally stack. How should this be resolved for Goran Varus, a Fighter 5 / Vampire 9, to achieve his intended combat potential? **(A) Retain the stacking for a total of 3 attacks** (allowing this exception); **(B) Use the highest number of attacks from a single feature (2)** and remove the stacking; or **(C) Re-evaluate the source of the 3rd attack** (e.g., if the 9th-level Multiattack (Vampire) feature is the intended source, or if a different power should be used)?\nA: Extra attacks stack.\n\nQ: The 9th-level Celerity upgrade's usage is listed as **5 uses/LR, resets SR**. Is this correct, or should it be the base rule of **PB times/LR** (5 times/LR), and the 'resets SR' applies only to the Action/Reaction as stated in the canon fact?\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bonus Action/Reaction (**5 uses/LR, resets SR**)\" at npc.vampiric_powers.type\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array. These decisions are final and must not be re-asked.\n",

However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character.

Even then, the result is a lowly and ravenous vampire spawn.\\nVampires in D&D have fairly standard powers and weaknesses but to make them a little more interesting I have expanded beyond those “standard” vampires below.

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: What is the mechanical effect of Goran Varus's **bloodforged sleep arrows (DC 16 Wis)**? The item's function is not defined in canon.\nA: Target falls unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake).\n\nQ: How should Goran Varus's 'relentless hunger for flawless order and absolute obedience' manifest in his **combat tactics**? His role as an overseer and Archer suggests a tactical, controlling style.\nA: CC and Control: use Binding Shot, Charm, and sleep arrows to remove enemies, then execute remaining targets one-by-one.\n\nQ: The essential base condition of Misty Escape—that the vampire must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed—is missing from the description.\nA: Add the destruction condition: 'When reduced to 0 HP outside his resting place, Goran transforms into a cloud of mist. **He must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.** He can change to a small cloud as a Bonus Action and make an immediate Reaction Move.'\n\nQ: The full effect of Unnatural Sight (cited as the source) includes specific low-light vision details which are missing. The canon states 'Vampires see in dim light within 120 feet as if bright light and in darkness as if dim light'.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The core assumption that the Celerity 9th-level 'extra attack' **stacks** with the Fighter 5 Extra Attack, allowing a total of **three attacks** per Attack action, is a **Critical Conflict** with RAW, as Extra Attack features from different sources do not generally stack. How should this be resolved for Goran Varus, a Fighter 5 / Vampire 9, to achieve his intended combat potential? **(A) Retain the stacking for a total of 3 attacks** (allowing this exception); **(B) Use the highest number of attacks from a single feature (2)** and remove the stacking; or **(C) Re-evaluate the source of the 3rd attack** (e.g., if the 9th-level Multiattack (Vampire) feature is the intended source, or if a different power should be used)?\nA: Extra attacks stack.\n\nQ: The 9th-level Celerity upgrade's usage is listed as **5 uses/LR, resets SR**. Is this correct, or should it be the base rule of **PB times/LR** (5 times/LR), and the 'resets SR' applies only to the Action/Reaction as stated in the canon fact?\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bonus Action/Reaction (**5 uses/LR, resets SR**)\" at npc.vampiric_powers.type\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array. These decisions are final and must not be re-asked.\n",

However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character.

The Misty Escape description was hardened to include the destruction condition: '**He must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.**' The Celerity usage was standardized to '5 uses/SR'. The legendary actions array was formatted to fit the normalized schema. \\n\\n**Critical Conflicts Found:**\\n1.  **Calcification Incompatibility:** Goran is a 9th-level vampire with Celerity and Legendary Actions (both implied by his stats/abilities), but the canon states Calcification is incompatible with both. Since he retains the non-magical B/P/S resistance, this implies he hasn't taken Calcification, but the content explicitly lists the Legendary Actions reset and non-magical B/P/S resistance, which are incompatible with the *listed* powers/weaknesses and the Calcification rule.\\n2.  **Mockery of Life Incompatibility:** Goran has **Heightened Regeneration** but is also listed with **Lingering Morality** (which is a different weakness from Mockery of Life, but the core conflict is the same type).\\n3.  **Charm Incompatibility (Abomination/Mockery of Life):** Goran has the **Charm** ability, which is incompatible with the **Abomination** weakness (not selected), but the content describes his 'unnaturally pale High Elf' appearance, which hints at disfigurement. The content also includes **Lingering Morality**, which is a separate weakness, but the key is that he has **Charm** when the Abomination rule says Charm is incompatible with visible monstrous disfigurement. The most direct conflict is the *incompatibility* between the power and the weakness (i.e., Mockery of Life and Charm/Heightened Regeneration).\\n\\n**Core Canon Breakdown (Critical Errors):**\\n* **Conflict 1 & 10:** Goran has **Legendary Actions** and the resistance to non-magical B/P/S damage. These abilities are incompatible with the **Calcification** weakness (Prerequisite: 9th level; lose resistance to non-magical B/P/S and lose natural AC; feeding 4 pints suppresses penalties for 1 hour; incompatible with Celerity, Legendary Actions, or Tooth and Claw). Goran must lose the non-magical B/P/S resistance *if* he has Calcification, and he cannot have Legendary Actions or Celerity *if* he has Calcification. Since he is Level 14 and has Celerity, the **Calcification** weakness is a logical exclusion, but the incompatibility fact about Legendary Actions is still a critical contradiction if the assumption is that the only incompatibility comes from taking Calcification.\\n* **Conflict 2:** Goran retains **resistance to non-magical B/P/S**. This is incompatible with the **Calcification** weakness. This is a critical conflict if the intent was for him to have a weakness that mandates losing that resistance.\\n* **Conflict 3 & 14:** Goran has **Heightened Regeneration** and **Lingering Morality** (or Mockery of Life, the facts are a little confusing here). Lingering Morality is not Mockery of Life and is compatible with Heightened Regeneration. However, the Mockery of Life rule states 'incompatible with Charm or Heightened Regeneration'. Goran has **Heightened Regeneration** and **Charm**, making him incompatible with **Mockery of Life** (which he hasn't taken), but the incompatibility between **Charm** and other weaknesses is also a key issue. The most direct conflict is the general incompatibility with **Charm** and visible monstrous disfigurement, which is not strictly chosen but is a canonical rule.\\n* **Conflict 11 (Charm Incompatibility):** Goran has the **Charm** action, but the **Abomination** weakness states Charm is incompatible with visible monstrous disfigurement. While Goran hasn't taken Abomination, the lore describes his appearance as 'unnaturally pale High Elf', and the rule is a general incompatibility statement for Charm with monstrous disfigurement. **Mockery of Life** is also incompatible with **Charm** and **Heightened Regeneration**, which Goran possesses both of.\\n\\n**Score Calculation:** Starting at 100. Deduct 10 points for each of the 7 critical conflicts, and 5 points for each of the 7 minor conflicts. Total deduction: $7 \\\\times 10 + 7 \\\\times 5 = 70 + 35 = 105$. The maximum deduction is 100. **Final Score: 0**.\"\n}",

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: What is the mechanical effect of Goran Varus's **bloodforged sleep arrows (DC 16 Wis)**? The item's function is not defined in canon.\nA: Target falls unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake).\n\nQ: How should Goran Varus's 'relentless hunger for flawless order and absolute obedience' manifest in his **combat tactics**? His role as an overseer and Archer suggests a tactical, controlling style.\nA: CC and Control: use Binding Shot, Charm, and sleep arrows to remove enemies, then execute remaining targets one-by-one.\n\nQ: The essential base condition of Misty Escape—that the vampire must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed—is missing from the description.\nA: Add the destruction condition: 'When reduced to 0 HP outside his resting place, Goran transforms into a cloud of mist. **He must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.** He can change to a small cloud as a Bonus Action and make an immediate Reaction Move.'\n\nQ: The full effect of Unnatural Sight (cited as the source) includes specific low-light vision details which are missing. The canon states 'Vampires see in dim light within 120 feet as if bright light and in darkness as if dim light'.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The core assumption that the Celerity 9th-level 'extra attack' **stacks** with the Fighter 5 Extra Attack, allowing a total of **three attacks** per Attack action, is a **Critical Conflict** with RAW, as Extra Attack features from different sources do not generally stack. How should this be resolved for Goran Varus, a Fighter 5 / Vampire 9, to achieve his intended combat potential? **(A) Retain the stacking for a total of 3 attacks** (allowing this exception); **(B) Use the highest number of attacks from a single feature (2)** and remove the stacking; or **(C) Re-evaluate the source of the 3rd attack** (e.g., if the 9th-level Multiattack (Vampire) feature is the intended source, or if a different power should be used)?\nA: Extra attacks stack.\n\nQ: The 9th-level Celerity upgrade's usage is listed as **5 uses/LR, resets SR**. Is this correct, or should it be the base rule of **PB times/LR** (5 times/LR), and the 'resets SR' applies only to the Action/Reaction as stated in the canon fact?\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bonus Action/Reaction (**5 uses/LR, resets SR**)\" at npc.vampiric_powers.type\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array. These decisions are final and must not be re-asked.\n",

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: What is the mechanical effect of Goran Varus's **bloodforged sleep arrows (DC 16 Wis)**? The item's function is not defined in canon.\nA: Target falls unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake).\n\nQ: How should Goran Varus's 'relentless hunger for flawless order and absolute obedience' manifest in his **combat tactics**? His role as an overseer and Archer suggests a tactical, controlling style.\nA: CC and Control: use Binding Shot, Charm, and sleep arrows to remove enemies, then execute remaining targets one-by-one.\n\nQ: The essential base condition of Misty Escape—that the vampire must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed—is missing from the description.\nA: Add the destruction condition: 'When reduced to 0 HP outside his resting place, Goran transforms into a cloud of mist. **He must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.** He can change to a small cloud as a Bonus Action and make an immediate Reaction Move.'\n\nQ: The full effect of Unnatural Sight (cited as the source) includes specific low-light vision details which are missing. The canon states 'Vampires see in dim light within 120 feet as if bright light and in darkness as if dim light'.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The core assumption that the Celerity 9th-level 'extra attack' **stacks** with the Fighter 5 Extra Attack, allowing a total of **three attacks** per Attack action, is a **Critical Conflict** with RAW, as Extra Attack features from different sources do not generally stack. How should this be resolved for Goran Varus, a Fighter 5 / Vampire 9, to achieve his intended combat potential? **(A) Retain the stacking for a total of 3 attacks** (allowing this exception); **(B) Use the highest number of attacks from a single feature (2)** and remove the stacking; or **(C) Re-evaluate the source of the 3rd attack** (e.g., if the 9th-level Multiattack (Vampire) feature is the intended source, or if a different power should be used)?\nA: Extra attacks stack.\n\nQ: The 9th-level Celerity upgrade's usage is listed as **5 uses/LR, resets SR**. Is this correct, or should it be the base rule of **PB times/LR** (5 times/LR), and the 'resets SR' applies only to the Action/Reaction as stated in the canon fact?\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bonus Action/Reaction (**5 uses/LR, resets SR**)\" at npc.vampiric_powers.type\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array. These decisions are final and must not be re-asked.\n",

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: What is the mechanical effect of Goran Varus's **bloodforged sleep arrows (DC 16 Wis)**? The item's function is not defined in canon.\nA: Target falls unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake).\n\nQ: How should Goran Varus's 'relentless hunger for flawless order and absolute obedience' manifest in his **combat tactics**? His role as an overseer and Archer suggests a tactical, controlling style.\nA: CC and Control: use Binding Shot, Charm, and sleep arrows to remove enemies, then execute remaining targets one-by-one.\n\nQ: The essential base condition of Misty Escape—that the vampire must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed—is missing from the description.\nA: Add the destruction condition: 'When reduced to 0 HP outside his resting place, Goran transforms into a cloud of mist. **He must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.** He can change to a small cloud as a Bonus Action and make an immediate Reaction Move.'\n\nQ: The full effect of Unnatural Sight (cited as the source) includes specific low-light vision details which are missing. The canon states 'Vampires see in dim light within 120 feet as if bright light and in darkness as if dim light'.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The core assumption that the Celerity 9th-level 'extra attack' **stacks** with the Fighter 5 Extra Attack, allowing a total of **three attacks** per Attack action, is a **Critical Conflict** with RAW, as Extra Attack features from different sources do not generally stack. How should this be resolved for Goran Varus, a Fighter 5 / Vampire 9, to achieve his intended combat potential? **(A) Retain the stacking for a total of 3 attacks** (allowing this exception); **(B) Use the highest number of attacks from a single feature (2)** and remove the stacking; or **(C) Re-evaluate the source of the 3rd attack** (e.g., if the 9th-level Multiattack (Vampire) feature is the intended source, or if a different power should be used)?\nA: Extra attacks stack.\n\nQ: The 9th-level Celerity upgrade's usage is listed as **5 uses/LR, resets SR**. Is this correct, or should it be the base rule of **PB times/LR** (5 times/LR), and the 'resets SR' applies only to the Action/Reaction as stated in the canon fact?\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bonus Action/Reaction (**5 uses/LR, resets SR**)\" at npc.vampiric_powers.type\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array. These decisions are final and must not be re-asked.\n",

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: What is the mechanical effect of Goran Varus's **bloodforged sleep arrows (DC 16 Wis)**? The item's function is not defined in canon.\nA: Target falls unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake).\n\nQ: How should Goran Varus's 'relentless hunger for flawless order and absolute obedience' manifest in his **combat tactics**? His role as an overseer and Archer suggests a tactical, controlling style.\nA: CC and Control: use Binding Shot, Charm, and sleep arrows to remove enemies, then execute remaining targets one-by-one.\n\nQ: The essential base condition of Misty Escape—that the vampire must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed—is missing from the description.\nA: Add the destruction condition: 'When reduced to 0 HP outside his resting place, Goran transforms into a cloud of mist. **He must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.** He can change to a small cloud as a Bonus Action and make an immediate Reaction Move.'\n\nQ: The full effect of Unnatural Sight (cited as the source) includes specific low-light vision details which are missing. The canon states 'Vampires see in dim light within 120 feet as if bright light and in darkness as if dim light'.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The core assumption that the Celerity 9th-level 'extra attack' **stacks** with the Fighter 5 Extra Attack, allowing a total of **three attacks** per Attack action, is a **Critical Conflict** with RAW, as Extra Attack features from different sources do not generally stack. How should this be resolved for Goran Varus, a Fighter 5 / Vampire 9, to achieve his intended combat potential? **(A) Retain the stacking for a total of 3 attacks** (allowing this exception); **(B) Use the highest number of attacks from a single feature (2)** and remove the stacking; or **(C) Re-evaluate the source of the 3rd attack** (e.g., if the 9th-level Multiattack (Vampire) feature is the intended source, or if a different power should be used)?\nA: Extra attacks stack.\n\nQ: The 9th-level Celerity upgrade's usage is listed as **5 uses/LR, resets SR**. Is this correct, or should it be the base rule of **PB times/LR** (5 times/LR), and the 'resets SR' applies only to the Action/Reaction as stated in the canon fact?\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bonus Action/Reaction (**5 uses/LR, resets SR**)\" at npc.vampiric_powers.type\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array. These decisions are final and must not be re-asked.\n",

When a vampire kills you, you die.

However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character. The person is dead and an evil being (usually) that looks like them now stands in their place. Vampires are largely harsh, merciless, and without compunction. Their tormented souls are twisted in pain. They care not about their previous life or the people in it save using the knowledge and memories to help gain power.\\nBecoming a Vampire requires a couple of things 1) being bitten by a Vampire and 2) then being drained of all your hit points and then some (beyond zero) by a Vampire. Even then, the result is a lowly and ravenous vampire spawn.\\nVampires in D&D have fairly standard powers and weaknesses but to make them a little more interesting I have expanded beyond those “standard” vampires below.

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: What is the mechanical effect of Goran Varus's **bloodforged sleep arrows (DC 16 Wis)**? The item's function is not defined in canon.\nA: Target falls unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake).\n\nQ: How should Goran Varus's 'relentless hunger for flawless order and absolute obedience' manifest in his **combat tactics**? His role as an overseer and Archer suggests a tactical, controlling style.\nA: CC and Control: use Binding Shot, Charm, and sleep arrows to remove enemies, then execute remaining targets one-by-one.\n\nQ: The essential base condition of Misty Escape—that the vampire must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed—is missing from the description.\nA: Add the destruction condition: 'When reduced to 0 HP outside his resting place, Goran transforms into a cloud of mist. **He must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.** He can change to a small cloud as a Bonus Action and make an immediate Reaction Move.'\n\nQ: The full effect of Unnatural Sight (cited as the source) includes specific low-light vision details which are missing. The canon states 'Vampires see in dim light within 120 feet as if bright light and in darkness as if dim light'.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The core assumption that the Celerity 9th-level 'extra attack' **stacks** with the Fighter 5 Extra Attack, allowing a total of **three attacks** per Attack action, is a **Critical Conflict** with RAW, as Extra Attack features from different sources do not generally stack. How should this be resolved for Goran Varus, a Fighter 5 / Vampire 9, to achieve his intended combat potential? **(A) Retain the stacking for a total of 3 attacks** (allowing this exception); **(B) Use the highest number of attacks from a single feature (2)** and remove the stacking; or **(C) Re-evaluate the source of the 3rd attack** (e.g., if the 9th-level Multiattack (Vampire) feature is the intended source, or if a different power should be used)?\nA: Extra attacks stack.\n\nQ: The 9th-level Celerity upgrade's usage is listed as **5 uses/LR, resets SR**. Is this correct, or should it be the base rule of **PB times/LR** (5 times/LR), and the 'resets SR' applies only to the Action/Reaction as stated in the canon fact?\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bonus Action/Reaction (**5 uses/LR, resets SR**)\" at npc.vampiric_powers.type\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array. These decisions are final and must not be re-asked.\n",

When a vampire kills you, you die.

However, class abilities and spells are usually gone (see keeping class abilities later). Vampirism isn’t an \\\"effect\\\" on your character. The person is dead and an evil being (usually) that looks like them now stands in their place. Vampires are largely harsh, merciless, and without compunction. Their tormented souls are twisted in pain. They care not about their previous life or the people in it save using the knowledge and memories to help gain power.\\nBecoming a Vampire requires a couple of things 1) being bitten by a Vampire and 2) then being drained of all your hit points and then some (beyond zero) by a Vampire.

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: What is the mechanical effect of Goran Varus's **bloodforged sleep arrows (DC 16 Wis)**? The item's function is not defined in canon.\nA: Target falls unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake).\n\nQ: How should Goran Varus's 'relentless hunger for flawless order and absolute obedience' manifest in his **combat tactics**? His role as an overseer and Archer suggests a tactical, controlling style.\nA: CC and Control: use Binding Shot, Charm, and sleep arrows to remove enemies, then execute remaining targets one-by-one.\n\nQ: The essential base condition of Misty Escape—that the vampire must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed—is missing from the description.\nA: Add the destruction condition: 'When reduced to 0 HP outside his resting place, Goran transforms into a cloud of mist. **He must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.** He can change to a small cloud as a Bonus Action and make an immediate Reaction Move.'\n\nQ: The full effect of Unnatural Sight (cited as the source) includes specific low-light vision details which are missing. The canon states 'Vampires see in dim light within 120 feet as if bright light and in darkness as if dim light'.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The core assumption that the Celerity 9th-level 'extra attack' **stacks** with the Fighter 5 Extra Attack, allowing a total of **three attacks** per Attack action, is a **Critical Conflict** with RAW, as Extra Attack features from different sources do not generally stack. How should this be resolved for Goran Varus, a Fighter 5 / Vampire 9, to achieve his intended combat potential? **(A) Retain the stacking for a total of 3 attacks** (allowing this exception); **(B) Use the highest number of attacks from a single feature (2)** and remove the stacking; or **(C) Re-evaluate the source of the 3rd attack** (e.g., if the 9th-level Multiattack (Vampire) feature is the intended source, or if a different power should be used)?\nA: Extra attacks stack.\n\nQ: The 9th-level Celerity upgrade's usage is listed as **5 uses/LR, resets SR**. Is this correct, or should it be the base rule of **PB times/LR** (5 times/LR), and the 'resets SR' applies only to the Action/Reaction as stated in the canon fact?\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bonus Action/Reaction (**5 uses/LR, resets SR**)\" at npc.vampiric_powers.type\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array. These decisions are final and must not be re-asked.\n",

Do NOT ask these questions again:\n\nQ: What is the mechanical effect of Goran Varus's **bloodforged sleep arrows (DC 16 Wis)**? The item's function is not defined in canon.\nA: Target falls unconscious for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake).\n\nQ: How should Goran Varus's 'relentless hunger for flawless order and absolute obedience' manifest in his **combat tactics**? His role as an overseer and Archer suggests a tactical, controlling style.\nA: CC and Control: use Binding Shot, Charm, and sleep arrows to remove enemies, then execute remaining targets one-by-one.\n\nQ: The essential base condition of Misty Escape—that the vampire must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed—is missing from the description.\nA: Add the destruction condition: 'When reduced to 0 HP outside his resting place, Goran transforms into a cloud of mist. **He must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed.** He can change to a small cloud as a Bonus Action and make an immediate Reaction Move.'\n\nQ: The full effect of Unnatural Sight (cited as the source) includes specific low-light vision details which are missing. The canon states 'Vampires see in dim light within 120 feet as if bright light and in darkness as if dim light'.\nA: Keep current value\n\nQ: The core assumption that the Celerity 9th-level 'extra attack' **stacks** with the Fighter 5 Extra Attack, allowing a total of **three attacks** per Attack action, is a **Critical Conflict** with RAW, as Extra Attack features from different sources do not generally stack. How should this be resolved for Goran Varus, a Fighter 5 / Vampire 9, to achieve his intended combat potential? **(A) Retain the stacking for a total of 3 attacks** (allowing this exception); **(B) Use the highest number of attacks from a single feature (2)** and remove the stacking; or **(C) Re-evaluate the source of the 3rd attack** (e.g., if the 9th-level Multiattack (Vampire) feature is the intended source, or if a different power should be used)?\nA: Extra attacks stack.\n\nQ: The 9th-level Celerity upgrade's usage is listed as **5 uses/LR, resets SR**. Is this correct, or should it be the base rule of **PB times/LR** (5 times/LR), and the 'resets SR' applies only to the Action/Reaction as stated in the canon fact?\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nQ: Review unassociated content: \"Bonus Action/Reaction (**5 uses/LR, resets SR**)\" at npc.vampiric_powers.type\nA: At 9th level the LR should be replaced with SR. That was the intent.\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT include any of the above questions in your proposals[] array. These decisions are final and must not be re-asked.\n",

Correcting all saves (DEX $\\\\rightarrow +10$ to $+11$, INT $\\\\rightarrow +9$, WIS $\\\\rightarrow +8$, CHA $\\\\rightarrow +10$) is **essential** for the stat block to be playable and appropriately challenging. The existing magical item bonuses and the Arcane Archer CC abilities are powerful.
