On her coffin, the lid has the spell Symbol cast on it, DC 23 to notice it. Trigger is the lid opening by anyone other than herself, the effect is “Death” doing 10d10 necrotic DC 23 Con save for half, in 60ft radius, to each target, each turn.\nShe casts Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound, and Tiny Servant with any unused 3rd and 4th level spell slots (potentially 6 servants) before resting each day and keeps them in the resting place while she rests. \n\n\nBefore Vampirism – The Lost Artificer of Amn\nBirth Name: Elspeth Varadin\nBackground: Amnian noblewoman, daughter of a powerful merchant house that specialized in enchanted wares and warforged exports.\nExpertise: A master of blood-bound artifice, developing life-infused constructs and arcane engines that blurred the line between life and machinery.\nDownfall:\nHer research was too valuable to simply outlaw or destroy. Instead, it sparked a vicious power struggle among Amnian merchant lords who sought to control or steal her discoveries.\nBetrayed by a former patron, she was forced to flee, vanishing into the lawless fringes of the Moonshaes.\nShe ended up in Snowdown, where she thought she could rebuild her work in secret.\n\nLady Erliza (formerly Elspeth Varadin)\nDescription (Human Life):\nElspeth Varadin was a woman whose presence was more often felt through her contraptions and innovations rather than her personal interactions. Quiet and introspective, Elspeth navigated social situations awkwardly, often appearing more comfortable amongst her mechanical inventions and arcane schematics than in conversation with her peers. Her piercing, intelligent eyes—deep emerald green—often glanced downward, rarely meeting the gaze of others directly, reflecting both her modesty and insecurity.\nDespite her social discomfort, Elspeth possessed a keen appreciation for elegance and beauty. While she never considered herself striking, she was meticulous in her attire, favoring intricately embroidered dresses in dark greens and deep blues accented with brass or silver adornments—practical yet refined, mirroring her approach to invention. Her dark brown hair, usually neatly bound in complex braids, was often streaked with soot or arcane residue from hours spent laboring over her latest contraptions.\nAs a master artificer, Elspeth’s inventions reflected her inner longing for perfection and grace. Her creations, ranging from simple yet beautiful clockwork automatons to elegantly shaped arcane tools, combined functionality with artistry. Her devices, powered by arcane cores or intricately crafted gears and enchanted runes, replicated spell effects through careful and precise mechanical construction. For instance, a “Shield” spell was generated by a wrist-mounted device that projected a translucent barrier, and “Levitate” was accomplished through delicate boots embedded with enchanted, mechanical pistons capable of brief elevation.\nWhile she admired beauty and grace in her designs, Elspeth was cautious not to augment herself directly. She saw herself as imperfect, yet hesitated at the idea of transforming her own body. Instead, she wore refined mechanical accessories that enhanced her natural abilities—bracers that improved her dexterity, a lens worn over one eye granting superior insight into her work, or gloves capable of minor magical manipulation. Her approach was always external augmentation, allowing her to maintain her fragile self-image intact.\nElspeth Varadin’s legacy as a human was defined by her exceptional skill in crafting minor magical items and elegant battle smith modifications. Her workshop was a testament to ingenuity, filled with objects that merged aesthetic elegance with precise functionality—an eternal reflection of her lifelong quest for perfection, grace, and mastery over the mechanical and arcane.\n\nThe Turning – The Price of Ambition\nInstead of finding refuge, she found something worse—a powerful vampire lord lurking in Snowdown before Amn’s expansion.\nThis vampire saw her potential and turned her not out of malice, but curiosity—what would an inventor do with immortality?\nUnlike most fledglings, she retained her mind—and killed her sire in a meticulously planned coup decades later, ensuring her absolute control over Snowdown’s underworld.\nThe Rise of the Bloodsmith\nWith time, she built her own empire—a mix of artifice, vampirism, and political maneuvering.\nShe used her deep knowledge of Amnian trade practices to invite their influence, ensuring a steady flow of goods, blood, and resources while keeping herself indispensable to both factions.\nHer ultimate goal?\nRetribution against the merchant lords who betrayed her.\nPower beyond vampirism—she seeks immortality through artifice, an unbreakable form of undeath, something neither stake nor sun could destroy.\nLord Ivar Talvios was a merchant and was himself turned by some long dead vampire. (No need for a family tree yet.) Erliza must have been looking to gain some coin for machines but then was turned. She eventually killed Jin with her inventions. But he is dead dead dead, not some monster experiment. That said, the monster experiment could be on some other vampire or undead.\n2. Varrus the Hollow – Undead Warforged Enforcer\nOnce a warforged mercenary in Amn, now a hybrid of construct and vampire, powered by a stolen soul core that keeps him bound to Lady Erliza.\nHis Purpose: Elite assassin, bodyguard, and enforcer of her will.\nCombat Style: Heavy plated armor, a blood-forged glaive that drains vitality, and unnatural speed for his size.\n3. The Crimson Cabal – Her “Advisors” & Vampiric Artificers\nA small council of elite artificers, necromancers, and vampires, all devoted to refining her Bloodforged Ascension project.\nNotable Members:\nMagister Relek Varno – An exiled Amnian arcanist who specializes in ritualistic blood magic, helping refine her soul-powered constructs.\nMistress Vaelin Drast – A former noblewoman turned political puppetmaster, running much of Snowdown’s mortal underworld.\n\nThe Bloodforged Legions – Her Personal Army\nBloodforged Knights – Undead fused with bloodsteel armor, immune to normal vampire weaknesses, each bound to Lady Erliza’s will.\nSteel Reapers – Mechanized constructs powered by stolen vitae, semi-autonomous hunters that track and extract blood for her research.\nExperimental Abominations – Malformed fusions of vampires and artifice, designed to test her vision of eternal, perfect undeath.\n\nLady Erliza’s Relationship with Viktau Kovenus\nViktau has only recently entered her orbit, but he immediately sees the potential of her work.\nHis Goal: Use her bloodforged machines to bring back his brother and sister.\nHer Goal: Leverage Viktau’s ancient knowledge to complete her transformation into something beyond a vampire.\nThe Dynamic:\nA fragile alliance—she is too valuable to simply kill, but Viktau does not fully trust her.\nErliza sees Viktau as a means to an end, while he sees her as a brilliant but reckless upstart who may yet serve his greater plans.\nBetrayal is inevitable, but who will strike first?\n\nNavrick & His Bloodline (The Rival Faction)\nNavrick Hawthorne was sired by Viktau but has since become his own force.\nNavrick’s Childer:\nSelari Sable – A ruthless pirate queen, controlling vampiric trade along the Moonshae coast.\nDresk Fenlow – A merchant underworld broker, overseeing the smuggling networks that Erliza now exploits.\nConflict Brewing:\nViktau wants all of them under control, but Navrick and his progeny have grown too independent.\nIf Erliza sways them, she could turn them against Viktau, further disrupting his centuries-long schemes.",
