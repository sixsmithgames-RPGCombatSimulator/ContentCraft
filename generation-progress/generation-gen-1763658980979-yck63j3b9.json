Central spire rises from its West Side, protruding about halfway from west wall of the keep,120+ ft tall. South Industrial / Forge Zone (above the underground blood forge) Massive chimneys, hoists, and winch houses sit here, aligned vertically with the Bloodforge beneath. Southeast Outer Ward (gates, stables, wagons) Outer ward: about 300 ft (east–west) by 240 ft (north–south) in the southeast corner, just inside the main gate. Holds stables for 60–80 horses, wagon sheds, smithy for mundane repairs, and a mustering yard. This ward nestles between the south wall, east wall, and the service wing; it does not encroach on the central keep’s space.

The light is harsh and unforgiving, turning the black basalt floor into a mirror that reflects your own cautious, flattened steps. The silence here is tactical; it forces you to rely entirely on sight, making the deep shadows along the eastern wall—where secured doors lead to the heart of the castle's bureaucracy—feel menacing and filled with unseen eyes.\n\nAs you walk the long passage, you pass recessed guard alcoves, their corners swallowed by darkness.
