There is a spiral staircase in the hall, about the midpoint of the hallway and it is the south side of the hall way. Across from the kitchen is a grand banquet hall that is 250 ft north to south and 200 ft east to west.  First and second floors of the keep: have vampire feeding areas and lounges, noble and vampire apartments.

The overview of each floor is below, I need you to start with the first floor of the castle at ground level. Only the first floor of the keep, see below. I have already decided a few things about this castle. Overall footprint Outer walls: about 1,040 ft (east–west) by 840 ft (north–south). Enclosed area: roughly 874,000 sq ft, just over 20 acres inside the walls. This comfortably holds multiple large internal wings, courtyards, and yards. Curtain walls East wall: 1,040 ft long, 70 ft high (taller for sunrise shade). West wall: 1,040 ft long, 45 ft high (mountains already give shade). North wall: 840 ft long, 45 ft high. South wall: 840 ft long, 60 ft high (coastal, sun and siege facing). You can picture the walls forming a big, slightly elongated rectangle. Think of the inside divided loosely into three east–west bands: north ward, central ward, south/industrial ward. Central keep base: about 300 ft (east–west) by 360 ft (north–south). It sits roughly in the middle of the castle, leaving wide courtyards on all sides. So, let's just build the keep first. Central spire rises from its West Side, protruding about halfway from west wall of the keep,120+ ft tall. Vertical structure Ground level: Kitchen in the north eastern most corner about 60 ft north to south, and 100 ft east to west. There is a large cookware and tools closet in the kitchen, lots of counter space for food prep of a medieval era kitchen. Several hearths or various sizes are on the northern wall. The double doors to the root cellar are on the Western wall, these are just doors, not an entire space. A large door way to the south access a main hallway that runs the length of the of the keep east to west and is about 30 feet wide with large double doors at the east end. There is a spiral staircase in the hall, about the midpoint of the hallway and it is the south side of the hall way. Across from the kitchen is a grand banquet hall that is 250 ft north to south and 200 ft east to west.  First and second floors of the keep: have vampire feeding areas and lounges, noble and vampire apartments. You will need to fill in the rest of the footprint of the main keep with sensible spaces fitting to this gothic style vampire castle. Go with more granite stone with basalt and steel accents, Lots of jade and blood red colors, lavish and luxury are the tone, gothic style, art that looks interesting but when you look closely it is gruesome depictions.\",\n  \"stage\": \"spaces\",\n  \"purpose\": {},\n  \"foundation\": {},\n  \"recent_spaces\": [],\n  \"instructions\": \"Generate next space with mesh_anchors.\"\n}",

The air is cool and still, save for the faint rhythmic sound of armored boots echoing off the walls.

The spiral staircase midpoint on the south wall is an intimidating corkscrew of cold stone, hinting at the wealth and darkness residing above.\\n\\nTo the north, a wide, open archway leads into the chaotic, humid world of the **Keep Kitchen**. Here, the atmosphere instantly shifts from chilling grandeur to frantic activity. Mortal cooks, sweating under the heat of the massive hearths that dominate the north wall, bark orders at four silent, soot-stained skeletons performing manual labor. The smell of roasting meat and herbs is thick, momentarily overpowering the metallic scent of the copper pots stacked high near the **Cookware and Tools Closet**.\\n\\nSouth of the main hallway is the immense **Grand Banquet Hall**, an overpowering space where two hundred feet of rich red granite floor extends to vaulted ceilings far overhead. A single, colossal feast table runs down the middle, flanked by silent, jade-inlaid columns. The light here is subdued and deep, making shadows pool beneath the arches.

      "description": "A compact south-side room set adjacent to the South Great Hall and the western exterior wall, intended as a controlled overlook and verification point for messengers, guards, and stewards moving around the castle. Lady Erliza insists on precision and predictability; schedules, logs, and orders are treated like clockwork here. The space is quiet and disciplined: multiple stone writing desks for parallel record-keeping, benches for runners awaiting orders, wall-mounted shelving for ledgers in active rotation, and secured chests for sensitive documents. Windows on the south and west walls provide limited light and controlled sightlines. The room supports fast checks and discreet coordination rather than formal meetings—information control matters as much as Bloodsteel in this place.",

The space is quiet and disciplined: multiple stone writing desks for parallel record-keeping, benches for runners awaiting orders, wall-mounted shelving for ledgers in active rotation, and secured chests for sensitive documents. Windows on the south and west walls provide limited light and controlled sightlines. The room supports fast checks and discreet coordination rather than formal meetings—information control matters as much as Bloodsteel in this place.",

Lady Erliza insists on precision and predictability; schedules, logs, and orders are treated like clockwork here. The space is quiet and disciplined: multiple stone writing desks for parallel record-keeping, benches for runners awaiting orders, wall-mounted shelving for ledgers in active rotation, and secured chests for sensitive documents. Windows on the south and west walls provide limited light and controlled sightlines. The room supports fast checks and discreet coordination rather than formal meetings—information control matters as much as Bloodsteel in this place.",

        "description": "A compact south-side room set adjacent to the South Great Hall and the western exterior wall, intended as a controlled overlook and verification point for messengers, guards, and stewards moving around the castle. Lady Erliza insists on precision and predictability; schedules, logs, and orders are treated like clockwork here. The space is quiet and disciplined: multiple stone writing desks for parallel record-keeping, benches for runners awaiting orders, wall-mounted shelving for ledgers in active rotation, and secured chests for sensitive documents. Windows on the south and west walls provide limited light and controlled sightlines. The room supports fast checks and discreet coordination rather than formal meetings—information control matters as much as Bloodsteel in this place.",

The space is quiet and disciplined: multiple stone writing desks for parallel record-keeping, benches for runners awaiting orders, wall-mounted shelving for ledgers in active rotation, and secured chests for sensitive documents. Windows on the south and west walls provide limited light and controlled sightlines. The room supports fast checks and discreet coordination rather than formal meetings—information control matters as much as Bloodsteel in this place.",
