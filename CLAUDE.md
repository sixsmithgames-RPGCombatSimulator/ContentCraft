No fallbacks allowed. You must use proper error trapping and excellent error messaging to the user instead of fallbacks.

Never assume data, open the files and look.
Always look for and resolve the root cause, no Band-Aids.

Ensure data structure is well planned and unified throughout for each data type.

Code should be modular such that functions are being reused and work the same way rather than inventing new ones for each area of the app.
